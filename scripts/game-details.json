You, responsible for lighting the core of this enormous, very wet rock, were going to bring human life to it. You held the fire at the end of your staff, ready to ignite the center most part of Earth, ready to fuel movement in very ground you stood on.  \n\nAnd not unlike Prometheus would one day defy great dangers to bring fire to men, you were about to dive deep into this tunnel and face the many dangers roaming, swimming around hungry for a snack...  \n\n/!\\ WebGL doesn't support Unity's particle systems.

      "name": "Diving for Oxygen",
      "body": "A short colony simulator where you try to lead your little divers to productive ends, like producing energy and oxygen, so that they can keep breathing.\n\nThere is no clear objective to the game, but you'll probably figure out the bounds of the sandbox after playing a little bit. For further details, spoilers: the main objective of the game is to keep the divers alive. For that, they need oxygen, which is produced by divers with the \"Oxygen mechanic\" job. To make oxygen, they need energy, which is produced by divers with the \"Energy producer\" job. There is a third job, \"Hauler\", which can help the other two jobs be more efficient by allowing them to keep working while the hauler moves around the relevant resources. The 3 lines of information on the divers' cards are: Job, Morale, and Oxygen. The job can be changed in the Command Divers menu. If morale falls too low, the diver will go for a walk instead of working to recover some. If oxygen falls too low, the diver will try to find oxygen to refill it. The fun of the game is really just watching the simulation go, didn't manage to add in too much interactivity.\n\nKeyboard and gamepad controls are supported, and the overlay at the bottom explains what the buttons do, but not the mouse (as you might expect from a colony sim).\n\nThe game is also on [itch.io](https://nc.itch.io/oxygen).\n\nJam details: I was originally going for the compo, but needed a bit more time. So the music and art was made by me during the jam. Music with Make Noise's Strega synthesizer (cut and filtered a little with Bitwig Studio), and art with Krita.\n\n![screenshot-01.png](///raw/6e/z/6b07a.png)",

In \"Listen to Me,\" you and a friend are thrown into the chaotic, infernal streets of Los Abismos, a city where reality and nightmare collide. The stakes? Deliver a steaming hot pizza against a backdrop of hellish upheaval. But there‚Äôs a twist: in this madcap, adrenaline-fueled journey, communication is everything.\n\n![SS5.png](///raw/f25/c2/z/6a7bc.png)\n\n**The Story:**  \nIn Los Abismos, a city once known for its vibrant culture is now overrun by cataclysmic chaos. The ground trembles as hellish flames burst forth from the asphalt, and treacherous sinkholes open up to the very depths of the underworld. Amidst the pandemonium, you and your co-op partner are the city‚Äôs unlikely heroes‚Äîpizza delivery drivers on a mission to save the day. With every delivery, you defy the relentless forces of doom and prove that sometimes, the only thing hotter than a pizza is your determination to overcome the abyss.\n\n![SS1.png](///raw/f25/c2/z/6a7bf.png)\n\n**Gameplay:**  \n\"Listen to Me\" is a dynamic, split-second cooperative experience where both players must communicate, strategize, and react in unison. One of you takes the wheel as the driver, mastering responsive steering, acceleration, and a high-stakes handbrake that could be the difference between narrowly avoiding a sinkhole and plunging into the depths of hell. The other, the navigator, must guide you through the maze-like streets of Los Abismos, calling out hazards and ensuring every twist and turn is perfectly timed.\n\nEvery delivery is a pulse-pounding race against time, with the environment evolving around you:\n- **Sinkholes to Hell:** Sinkholes don't just suck you in‚Äîthey‚Äôre portals that lead directly to the fiery pits of the underworld. Dodge them, or risk being dragged down to eternal damnation!\n- **Hellish Eruptions:** The city is alive with the sounds and fury of the underworld. Infernal rifts burst from the streets, transforming everyday chaos into a symphony of destruction.\n- **Dynamic Challenges:** As the environment shifts and intensifies, your teamwork and quick thinking become paramount. Listen to your partner‚Äîbecause in \"Listen to Me,\" every command could be a lifeline.\n\n![SS2.png](///raw/f25/c2/z/6a7c3.png)\n\n**Art & Audio:**  \nImmerse yourself in a world crafted with meticulous detail. The custom art style of \"Listen to Me\" perfectly balances the surreal beauty of a city on the brink of collapse with the gritty, high-energy reality of your mission. Every visual element is paired with a dynamic audio experience powered by FMOD:\n- **Dynamic Music:** The music adapts to the chaos around you, rising and falling in intensity as you race through the streets.\n- **Immersive Sound Effects:** From the roar of the engine to the screech of the brakes and the ominous rumble of hell‚Äôs fury, every sound is designed to pull you deeper into the experience.\n- **Co-op Audio Cues:** Communication isn‚Äôt just spoken‚Äîit‚Äôs heard in the very fabric of the game‚Äôs soundscape, ensuring that both players are in sync, even when words fail.\n\n**Why \"Listen to Me\" Stands Out:**\n- **Innovative Co-op Gameplay:** Every moment requires perfect teamwork. Whether you're steering through a hail of demonic fire or narrowly avoiding a sinkhole, you must truly listen to each other to survive.\n- **Aesthetic Brilliance:** With custom art and meticulously designed audio, every scene is a masterpiece of chaos and beauty.\n- **High-Octane Action:** Fast-paced, challenging, and full of surprises, \"Listen to Me\" pushes the boundaries of cooperative multiplayer gameplay.\n- **Darkly Humorous Narrative:** Embrace the absurdity of a pizza delivery service operating amid the collapse of the underworld‚Äîa story that‚Äôs as hilarious as it is harrowing.\n\n**Join the Delivery:**  \nIn a world where the ordinary meets the infernal, \"Listen to Me\" challenges you to deliver hope‚Äîand pizza‚Äîagainst impossible odds. Gear up, communicate, and dive into the madness of Los Abismos. The fate of the city (and your dinner) depends on your ability to listen, react, and work together.\n\nGet ready for a wild ride where every command counts, and every moment is a battle against the abyss. Are you ready to deliver?  \n**Listen to Me** is waiting‚Äîlet the infernal adventure begin!\n\n![SS3.png](///raw/f25/c2/z/6a7c8.png)",

      "body": "# Save humanity from impending doom!\n\nIn the year 2075, astronomers discovered an asteroid heading towards Earth with an alarmingly high confidence of impact. The United Nations has assumed rule of the entire planet, creating manned drill ships to explore the subterranean parts of the planet. If all goes according to plan, there will be a network of thousands of navigation beacons and subsurface caves to construct emergency shelters and save the human race. You are Doug, pilot of the Iron Eulogy and the material scientists who invented the metal alloy the ship is built from, stronger than steel and harder than diamond. \n\n*NOTE: Please use the GitHub download link for the latest working build. Hours before the deadline, we encountered issues with physics not working well on the build. Hopefully it's a small gaff and we can fix it before the final playable build, but if not, please keep that in mind. Thanks!*\n\n![Overall.png](///raw/909/d5/z/6b140.png)\n\n# Gameplay\n\nUse WASD to move and Space to interact with a module. Use the mouse to manage items and hit space again to end interaction with a module.\n\nThe player may carry one item at a time and insert it into appropriate slots in modules.\n\nThere are many important modules on the ship:\nNOTE: Most modules have a power state. Modules with a power state do not do anything when turned off.\n\n## Engine\nControl the speed and heading using the helm located on the engine.\n\n![engine.png](///raw/909/d5/z/6b144.png)\n\n## Power Plant\nProduce power for the ship at the power plant. Load fuel to keep the ship running. If power demand exceeds production, an alarm will sound and all modules will perform at a reduced efficiency.\n\n## Cooling Array\nRemove heat from the ship with the cooling array. Load coolant to prevent an overheat condition. If the ship is overheated for 30 seconds, the crew perishes and the game ends in defeat.\n\n## Collection Drills\nResources are collected by using WASD on the collection drills when the ship is stopped. Ore amount and type is indicated by the scanner interface.\n\n![Drill.png](///raw/909/d5/z/6b149.png)\n\n## Storage Locker\nItems are stored in the locker in the middle of the ship. \n\n![Storage.png](///raw/909/d5/z/6b14b.png)\n\n## Foundry\nCraft upgrades, coolant, fuel, and navigation beacons at the foundry. Recipes shown are based on available resources. Collect more resources and go deeper to unlock more recipes.\n\n![Crafting.png](///raw/909/d5/z/6b14e.png)\n\n## Jettison Hatch\nEject excess cargo as needed through the jettison hatch. Ejecting a navigation beacon of the correct tier (based on Fathom number) will end the game in victory and record your depth, a.k.a your score.\n\n# Goal of the Game\n\nManage your power, heat, and resources to go as deep as possible! Note that every 1,000 m you will advance a Fathom.\n\n## Fathoms and Sectors\n-Fathom 0-2: Upper Strata (T1)\n-Fathom 3-5: Lithosphere (T2)\n-Fathom 6-8: Asthenosphere (T3)\n-Fathom 9+: Mantle (T4)\n\n## Defeat Condition\nThe crew will perish if the internal temperature is above 50 C for 30 seconds.\n\n## Victory Condition\nPlace a navigation beacon in the jettison hatch of the same tier based on your current Sector. This will end the game and record your depth/score!\n\n# Assets\n\nAll assets were created by the team or modified from existing media to be transformative.\n\n## Game\n-Unity Editor 6000.0.45f1\n\n## Audio\n-Audacity\n-MUSIC MAKER 2024\n\n## Sprites\n-Aseprite\n\n# Thank You\nWe hope you enjoy our game! LD57 was a blast!",

Sorry about that.\n\n\n\nThe game is a bit difficult so here are some tips:\n- You are immortal, as you have no head, however the only thing that can kill you is rooms sinking or the outside.\n- Enemies block you from picking things up.\n- Throwing objects can be spammed and is likely to kill multiple enemies.\n- You do not have to kill the enemies, just run past them if its more convenient.\n",

You have no choice but to follow your shady boss's instruction and search the ocean floor for something that appears very important to her. With every hint you find down in the depth, the goal of the mission becomes more and more mysterious, and it's up to you to find out what really is happening here.\n\nCan you make it?\n\n== Controls ==\n\nYou are a deep-ocean robot, *use [W], [A] and [D] to move*. Your jump with [W] can later be upgraded to a double- (triple- or even better) jump by buying the Booster upgrade.\n\nYou are *equipped with a claw arm, which you steer with your mouse and which you can attach to objects or the ground by pressing the mouse and dragging in the direction you want the item to move.\nDrag the items to the elevator to return them to the ship and sell them for money.\n\nMoving on the ocean floor costs you energy (also upgradable), which is shown in the top.\n\nIf you're stuck, you can *reset your player by pressing [R]*.\n\n*Pro Tip*: Your robot arm can also hook onto the ocean floor, which allows you to use it as a grappling hook - allowing for crazy cool underwater pro-player movements.\n",

Just you, your submarine, and the crushing weight of the sea.\n\n# Screenshots:\n![pack-screenshot.png](///raw/bdc/2/z/6aab2.png)\n\n\n\n# Key Features:\n- üåä First-Person Submarine Cockpit: Feel every creak and groan of your vessel as the depths close in.\n- ü¶à Tension-Fueled Shark Encounters: Outmaneuver aggressive predators lurking in the dark.\n- üß≠ Strategic Route Planning: Choose your path wisely‚Äîone wrong turn could be your last.\n- ü´Å Oxygen Management: Every second counts.

Others ‚Äî of dungeons, the mind, or something more mystical.\n We weren‚Äôt sure at first either ‚Äî until we stumbled upon our version of it:\n the depth of a moment.\n\n![5.png](///raw/16f/46/z/6ae24.png)\n\nThis is a story about memories.\nSmall, warm, awkward, important. Sometimes almost forgotten, but somehow still precious. The kind that stay with us and quietly keep us warm on especially cold nights.We wanted to make a game about simple things ‚Äî sitting by the fire, burning marshmallows, a guitar that‚Äôs still not quite in tune.\nBecause it‚Äôs these little, imperfect, sometimes silly moments that bring out the truest emotions ‚Äî and become the mosaic of our lives.\n\n![9.png](///raw/16f/46/z/6ae35.png)\n\nSure, we only had three days, and we didn‚Äôt manage to build everything we imagined.\n But we focused on what mattered most: the atmosphere.\n The kind you don‚Äôt explain with words.\n The kind that lives in the tiniest details.\nWe hope you can feel it too.\n\n![7.png](///raw/16f/46/z/6ae41.png)",

I will use it more from now on.\n\nAs usual, the jam didn't go as expected. Initially I had different ideas, I wanted to make an adventure game using some mechanics derived from different meanings of depth, but ended up with something quite different (though the main mechanic is more or less the same).\n\nOverall I'm satisfied as this time I submitted a \"full\" game, with menus, audio and a whole level. Good enough for the first Ludum Dare. Let's see if I can make it better the next time.\n\n--------------------\n*I say it in plural but there is only one level. I didn't have time to integrate everything and packed only what was working so I could submit it in time.",

One dreadful day, a terrible argument finally broke out between them, and as their relationship fractured, they found themselves drawn into the Depths, a place which makes their thoughts and emotions into reality.\n\nUnfortunately, their turmoil and conflict took on a shape of its own in the Depths: as their friendship broke apart, so did their very bodies! Now scattered in pieces across the Depths, only one way forward remains for them: to reconcile and reconnect by exploring their inner worlds!\n\nReassemble the trio and unlock their lost talents as you proceed. Frances uses her strength to topple obstacles, Louisa leaps over holes in the ground without a care, and Alexis's introverted nature lets her avoid enemies and reveal secrets. Beware of hazards in the Depths: death is only a minor inconvenience, but there are dozens of deadly traps and hostile spirits eager to bar your escape regardless!\n\nKeyboard controls: WASD/arrow keys to move, Space/Z to perform actions.\n\nGamepad controls: D-pad/left analog stick to move, bottom face button (Nintendo B/PlayStation X/Xbox A) to perform actions.\n\nCreated in Godot 4.4.1. 3D assets created in Blender. 2D textures created in Aseprite.

      "body": "My First Ludum Dare. It was a journey through pressure and growth\nThis was my very first Ludum Dare, and going into it, I didn‚Äôt know exactly what to expect‚Äîjust that I wanted to push myself, build something from scratch, and see how far I could go in 72 hours.\n\nWhen the theme ‚ÄúDepths‚Äù was revealed, I immediately thought of hidden spaces‚Äîbasements, dungeons, eerie places buried under the surface. I settled on building a game about curiosity, darkness, and discovery. Originally, I imagined a multi-level basement, but due to time constraints and the need to use free assets, I shifted to dungeon environments.\n\nFrom the start, things were intense. I struggled with setting up systems, tracking bugs, fixing lighting issues, managing collisions, and a hundred other small but crucial details. It was exhausting‚Äîmentally and physically. I lost track of time, skipped meals, and barely slept. At one point, the pressure felt like too much, and anxiety crept in. But somehow, I kept going.\n\nI can‚Äôt say it was smooth or even that I enjoyed every moment of it‚Äîbut I grew. A lot. I learned how to prioritize, when to stop tweaking things that weren‚Äôt critical, and how to build even when everything felt like it was falling apart.\n\nAt the end of it, I finished my game. It‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs flawed. But it‚Äôs mine. And it was made during a time of emotional weight and uncertainty. Releasing it felt like a personal victory‚Äîbecause it represents not just a game, but a moment where I didn‚Äôt give up, even when I felt like I could.\n\nTo anyone else trying this for the first time‚Äîknow that it‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed. What matters is showing up, learning, and finishing something that matters to you.\n\nI‚Äôm proud of what I made. Not because it‚Äôs perfect, but because I got through the process and learned so much more than just game dev.\n\nNow about the game: \nIn this game you are trapped in a dungeon and have to get out of the dungeon alive. And the player has to find the exit before the monsters kill them.![Screenshot 2025-04-06 193741.png](///raw/0c6/36/z/6a46d.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-06 194104.png](///raw/0c6/36/z/6a45c.png)\n![Screenshot 2025-04-08 080424.png](///raw/0c6/36/z/6b314.png)",

Now it is time to take samples of the mutated life forms and retrieve the three Autonomous  P.E.A.R.L monitors which contain a mineral and nutient dense physical record of the oceans.\n\n## To control the Automated Diver:\nUse WASD Arrow Keys or the Left Analog Stick to move\nPress Space or the Right Action Button to swing the sample net\nPress Shift or the Bottom Action Button to Dash\n\n## Objectives:\nYour role as an operator will be terminated should you fail to reach the profit target for a dive. Your role will be apsred should you succeed in collecting the P.E.A.R.L monitor for the area.\n\nCollect samples of fish, rarer fish will spawn lower, scans indicate abnormal biologies with the deepest dwelling fish absorbing environmental metals and integrating them into their biology.\n\nYou have a limited number of sample jars but may purchase some more in the Overview Screen.\n\nCollect samples of seaweed and coral, these are less valuable but do not  have limited storage\n\nBy collecting the pearl for an area you will be able to progress to the next dive site, each dive is deeper and spawns rarer and more dangerous fish.\n\n# Credits\nMade for Ludum Dare 57 with the theme of \"Depths\" in 72 hours.\n\nGame designed and programmed by [Hyphinett](https://hyphin.net)\nBackground Music by Hyphinett\n\nArt by [Tetraminose](https://bsky.app/profile/tetraminose.bsky.social)\n\nSFX & Additional Music by [Kaitlyn \"IDKAY\" Cooper](https://bsky.app/profile/idkayuk.bsky.social)\n\nFont: [Salty](https://somepx.itch.io/pixel-font-salty) by [Somepx](https://bsky.app/profile/somepx.com)\n",

At the end of each level, there is a staircase downwards to enter a new level.\n\nEach level is more difficult than the former - there will be increased number of spawn points and more rooms.\n\nThe character has three continuous stages: light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid-eye-movement.\n\nDuring light sleep, minds work at a small level so he has low visibility to things around him.\n\nDuring REM, his minds work fast and walks at a higher speed (in his dream), has high visibility, but the rate of zombies spawning becomes higher.\n\nThe conditions of deep sleep is in between the two extremes.\n\nHe has a sword to protect him - he must swing his sword to make zombies disappear.\n\nAfter diving down five levels, he finally stops suffering from the nightmare.\n\n### Controls:\nWASD - move horizontally/vertically\n\nLeft click - activate sword (for 1 second)\n\nThe character faces towards the mouse.\n\nTo kill enemies, activate the sword and swing it to them.",

Orbit around enemies, lead your shots. Stay on the move to avoid fire.\n- :boom: **Destructible terrain:** Asteroids crumble, ships turn into wreckage. The terrain works as cover... for a time.\n- :shield: **Projectile piercing:** Shots can pierce through objects, slowing them down. Projectiles inherit your ship's velocity: go faster and do more damage.\n- :bow_and_arrow: **Every shot counts:** Your targets aren't sitting still. Aim your shots carefully, and keep moving to avoid the return fire while you reload.\n\n## How to Play\n\nMouse and keyboard required.\n\n- **Move the mouse** to turn your ship.\n- **W/A/S/D** to move.\n- **Left click** to fire your primary weapon.\n- **Right click** to fire your secondary weapons.\n- **Left Shift** to boost forward.\n\n## Credits\n\n- **Sam Minh Ly**: System design, level design, balancing, audio\n- **Mika Molenkamp**: Programming, UI, audio\n- **Jorrit Neslo**: Environment art, UI art, visual effects, shader magic\n\nFont is 'Ethnocentric' by Typodermic Fonts, 'Abel' by MADType, licensed under SIL Open Font License. Sounds from freesounds.org. Music is iX by cinameng, and Fate of the Irrbloss OST by xCirrex.\n\n# GOOD LUCK, PILOT\n\n_(No web build this time, sorry!

Right now the game is essentially a walking simulator with a cool (but admittedly a tad jank) mech to play around with. We'd envisioned a fuel system where the player would need to exit the mech and gather fuel to continue the journey, but alas Game Jam's gonna Game Jam. (The mech still has fuel, but it'll take a long time to drain it all) Perhaps we'll revisit/finish this, I really like this character controller and enjoyed Godot and especially gdscript way more than I imagined I would. Hope you have fun playing around with it!",

But if you'd like to know where it started, check it out [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/depths-of-darvaza)! \n\n### How to play\nYou can use either keyboard or gamepad. It should detect both PS5 and Xbox controllers. I haven't tested it with older controllers but they should work.\n\nMove     - Arrow Keys or DPAD/Left Analog stick.  \nShoot    - Z Key or the X button  \nJump     - Space bar or the A button  \nInteract - X Key or the B button   \n\n\n### Story so far...\nDarvasa is home to a corporate mining industry. Recently, there's been an explosion at one of the facilities. It's your job as a member of the Conflict Resolution Outfit Unit to determine the cause of the accident, descend into the depths of Darvasa once again and find the foreman in charge of the operation. If he's still alive... \n\n### Credits\nSkawly for the cover art <3   \nConduit for the voice acting and amazing OST!  \nJeremy and Dalton for hanging out while we worked on the jam.   \nTony for helping me play test the initial build!   \nAND YOU, for taking the time to play my game. Thanks!   \n\n\n\n",

The main culprit was the health restoration hearts were being spawned on an incorrect parent node causing, but not limited to:\n - Random crashes\n - Index out of bounds\n - Layers that should stop spinning to keep spinning\n - Gates to next depth layer not opening when triggered\n - Final boss to not spawn\n - Other misc issues and corrections\n\n\nSince during the Jam we never implemented settings, credits, or how to play, how to play:\n\nMouse to aim, W to move towards mouse, S to move away from mouse. Left mouse for melee attack, right mouse for ranged. There is a short cooldown on melee and you have limited Mana (which regens over time) for ranged attacks.\n\nWhen moving down layers, you will sometimes YEET across the screen, this is due to the game deciding that you were in an unwalkable area and relocating you (sometimes violently) to a walkable area.\n\n\n\nCredits:\nAnneArkey: for creating/modifying miscellaneous graphics to fit the theme we were going for, as well as creating/sourcing all the sound and music for the game.\n\nRubixNoob13: The BIGGEST ball of spaghetti code I've made in a while, however it somehow (mostly) works\n\n- Graphics - \nPublic Domain: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\nBat sprites by awesomeduck\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/flying-monster-frames-16x16\n\nStairs tile by Oiboo\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/stairs-2\n\nSpider sprites by camacebra\nhttps://twitter.com/camacebra\nhttps://camacebra.itch.io/spider-pixel-art-pack-16x16\n\n\nCC-BY 3.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nGrass & Rock tiles by Buch\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/outdoor-tiles-again\n\nMagic Pixel Art by peony\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/magic-pixel-art\n\n\n\nUnknown attribution:\nRock tile set on Pixilart\nhttps://www.pixilart.com/draw/cave-tileset-cea01fd577b0c69\n\nAll other art was made or edited in Aesprite:\nhttps://www.aseprite.org/\n\n\nAudio\n\nCC-BY 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nThrone Room by Visager\nhttps://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_-_Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2_-_19_Throne_Room_-Loop-/\n\nEerie Mausoleum by Visager\nhttps://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_-_Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2_-_29_Eerie_Mausoleum_-Loop-/\n\nInside the Tower by Visager\nhttps://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_-_Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2_-_30_Inside_the_Tower_-Loop-/\n\nAll other sound effects were created in BFXR\nhttps://www.bfxr.net/",

Get ready to defend, shoot, and strategize your way to victory!\n\n\n## Controls  \n- Place a turret if enough money is available (**E Key**)  \n- Move player forward or backwards (**W/S Keys**)  \n- Strafes player left or right (**A/D Keys**)  \n- Fire bullets (**Left Mouse or spacebar**)  \n\n## Game Round\n1. Each round starts with a quiet period where you can place turrets and collect dropped coins\n2. Next, a new wave of enemies begins. Survive until the last enemy is destroyed and move onto the next game round; Die and its game over.\n",

Decide carefully if you want to rush on the waves or take a deeper, less dangerous route but which drains your pressure and is littered with minefields.\nThe game is not completed but still challenging to beat.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Use WASD to move around on the map. You can only turn while moving.\n- Use Q+E to move up and down. Use the right height bar to check for enemy mines, torpedos and the ground.\n- Use Page up + Page down to zoom\n- Use SPACE to spawn a noisemaker attracting the enemy torpedos in range (5s cooldown)\n\nTIP: don't run into or (to) near the coast\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** This game uses some elements of conspiracy theorys as a lore element. This is not due to us belivieving in them but to poke fun of them.\n\n### Thanks\nSince we are not good at sound or music design we used open art created by the following persons on OpenGameArt.org:\n- Ove Melaa\n- Scribe\n- Chabull\n\nHeightmap data has been rendered using\n`https://tangrams.github.io/heightmapper`",

      "body": "Minesweeper meets deep-rock excavation!\n\nCarefully excavate a crumbling mine in search of gems, energy, and framing materials. Use arrow keys or WASD to move around and excavate. \n\nThe core mechanic here is that each soil type contributes a different, slightly random amount of strength to both its row and column. If the strength of a column or row ever drops too low, the entire mine collapses and it is game over.\n\nGreen gems are the scoring currency. Pink bolts give energy, which is constantly decreasing while moving and even more so when excavating. Orange framing materials let  you automatically shore up an area that would otherwise cause a collapse.",

I hope you'll enjoy my little game!",

      "body": "Into the Depths is a solo, push-your-luck, campaign card game. It's analog, meaning you'll need a surface and a standard deck of cards to play. Something to write with and on is needed, too, but you can use a digital notepad or Google Doc or whatever.\n# Do You Dare Enter the Depths?\nAs shopkeeper and owner of The Summit Shop, at the foot of the Mountainy mountains, you struggle to earn enough to survive. One day, you discover an old mine that's full of trinkets and goodies.\n\nAfter earning enough to comfortably make it through the week, you discover a crack that leads deeper. And deeper. And even deeper...\n\nWith each new area comes more valuable trinkets, but also a shadowy figure determined to make you leave. And a drill-powered crystal of darkness. Mysteries surround you, but all you care about is that you get MORE...\n# No Printing Required\nWhile this IS an analog game, you don't have to print anything. I do recommend opening the PDF twice, though: once to follow along with the game, and again to check on the card effects (after you reach chapter two).\n# This Is a LONG Game, But You Can Make It Shorter\nPlaying through the entire game should take an estimated 2-3 hours total, but may take more or less time depending on your reading speed. The document is 40 pages long, including the cover and table of contents: about 2/3 narrative and 1/3 rules for playing through the five chapters. The full game also requires playing through most, if not all, of the first four chapters at least once.\n\nTo make the game shorter, you may pretend you've failed at each chapter as many times as necessary to unlock all of the upgrades to your boons for that chapter. Doing so does skip over part of the meaning of the game, though, and detracts from the experience. The game is purposely set up to be very difficult at the beginning of each chapter, then get easier and easier, both to capture the repetitive nature of mining and also to show you that repeating something makes you better at it. Even when luck is a huge part of the driving force.",

Hold onto your breath and traverse through a tricky cave system in pitch black. Try not to panic (try hitting space bar a couple of times to steady your breathing), use left click (on the ground next to the player)to crawl through the cave and get to the end.!\n\n This is me and my best friend's first game jam ever, and we used this jam to learn godot, game design/sound design and interacting with GDScript.I've used godot sparingly in the past, but this is my bestie's first time, so pls be kind lol. The game still has a couple of quirks and bugs here and there, so we apologize in advance\n\nWe really enjoyed the process and I hope you enjoyed the game <3, excuse us for the shit art\n\nTy KenneyNL for the free player sprite `![Gameplay.PNG](///raw/826/84/z/6acfa.png)![Menu.PNG](///raw/826/84/z/6acfd.png)",

Press the spacebar to spin on the spot, collecting dirt and debris as you go. The more you gather, the bigger your disgusting ball becomes. Once it's ready, dash forward and smash through whatever's in your way.\n\nAcross three increasingly weird stages, you‚Äôll face physics-based challenges that require creativity and stubbornness. No lives. No Game Over. Just you, the dirt, and a strange journey ahead.\n\nThe more you spin, the weirder it gets.\n\n‚Äî\n\nTeam: Djosef Wytemalhos, Eric Dantas & Sabrina Lacerda.!![Captura de Tela 2025-04-07 aÃÄs 21.13.04.png](///raw/036/46/z/6ae95.png)![Captura de Tela 2025-04-07 aÃÄs 21.12.18.png](///raw/036/46/z/6ae9b.png)![Captura de Tela 2025-04-07 aÃÄs 21.15.30.png](///raw/036/46/z/6aea5.png)",

I was much too ambitious so I ended up with a game that, while fully finished and playable from end to end, was missing a number of features I intended to implement. So, when you're playing, if you think, \"gee this would be better if X\" I probably meant to do it and ran out of time.\n\nThis was a solo dev effort, just not enough time to get everything wrangled for the compo. So, since I was submitting for the jam anyway, I decided to get some cool free sfx in there!\n\n\nIf anyone needs a mac or windows build instead of html5, please lmk and I can get one up.\n\n## --Credits--\n\nAll art, code, and game design\nmade by kristinamay\nfor Ludum Dare 57\n\nfont is ‚ÄòMacondo‚Äô (fonts.google.com)\n\nthanks to my playtester Matt!\n\n\nSound effects and background music attributions:\n\nFailure 01 by rhodesmas -- freesound.org/s/342756/ -- License: Attribution 3.0\n\nSuccess by Sjonas88 -- freesound.org/s/538554/ -- License: Creative Commons 0\n\nmixing.mp3 by artur_mb -- freesound.org/s/671469/ -- License: Creative Commons 0\n\nBlender (Contact mic) by nicStage -- freesound.org/s/462274/ -- License: Attribution 4.0\n\nChicken sizzling in a pot.wav by natemarler -- freesound.org/s/338697/ -- License: Attribution NonCommercial 4.0\n\npixels_on_the_moon by smethng -- freesound.org/s/656689/ -- License: Attribution 4.0\n\n\nSource code can be found here: https://github.com/kristinalustig/LD57",

You will need to dig through earth and rock to escape from the undersea caverns.\n\nYour submarine is equipped with a limited supply of harpoons. Harpoons can pin Cephaloids and can even pierce through a whole line of them for a combo bonus. You can pick up your harpoons that missed a Cephaloid, and you can find more harpoons amidst the treasures of the sea.\n\nIf a Cephaloid catches you, you lose a life. Your harpoon supply resets to 5 with each life.\n\nCollect treasures and move toward the surface to score points. Extra lives are awarded every 25,000 points.\n\n### Scoring\n\n* Gold: 500 points\n* Diamond: 2000 points\n* Chest: 5000 points\n* Pinning a Cephaloid: 100 points + combo bonus\n* Moving toward the surface: 10 points per foot of depth\n* **Extra life every 25,000 points**\n\n### License\n\nSoftware, graphics, and sound copyright (c) 2025 Adam Higerd\n\nTitle art copyright (c) 2025 Ginny Higerd\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ‚ÄúSoftware‚Äù), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Oh well... anyway, the theme was depths and you're in a magic cave trying to grapple down an unforgiving path that wants to blow you\n\nback to the beginning of the map.\n\nCan you meander from grappling spot to grappling spot while trying not to fall into the wind that somehow exists coming from the bottom of a cave?  Can you find the treasure that this mysterious wind is protecting? \n\nProbably not. This is a game jam and I barely finished. Don't get your hopes up too high.\n\nAnyway, SPACE is action/grapple, move with A and D, boost while swinging with A and D. If you fall too far, you get sent back, so don't fall.\n\nGood luck!",

I forgot to label it. what's there is for my debugging but it works)\n(The game doesn't have a \"win\" scenario. it just goes on forever)\n\n**LEVELS SCALE!** \n\nOn each level, there are more rooms, more enemies spawn per room and move faster. Health replenishes each floor. Couldn't make health drops :( sorry. I tried.\n\nControls:\n\n```\nW - forward\nA - left\nS - down\nD - right\n\nLMB (Left Mouse Button/click) - Attack - swing sword\nRMB (Right Mouse Button/click) - block - raise shield in front of you\n\nTo release the mouse, press Alt + Tab (sorry I didn't make it a button)\n\n```\n\nWoo Hoo! Another Solo Jam under my belt. Haven't done it alone since my first Jam! and it's (technically) a full game!... and by that I mean it has \n\n**Things I wish I could have done:**\n\n1. Health and item drops\n2. Different weapons, including bows and other swords\n3. different shields with different sizes or weights or something\n4. more enemies and bosses - sorry there's only 1 enemy type of each but at least they scale per level\n5. Win state - although I do like the infinite version.\n6. tweaked enemies\n7. better sounds - yeah... my sounds are pretty basic clips of recordings of myself\n8. music - ugh this needs it but I lowered the priority on that to get the game out. a few sound effects were last\n9. improved environments - yeah they are flat and boring as hell but I was trying to push this through on my own! QQ I wanted to add rocks and textures and torches and spikes and pits and so much more.\n10. controller support\n11. better player controls. you can't even jump. wasn't critical so I put it off and ended up not having enough time\n12. title screen menu and more options. \n\nTools used:\nGame Engine: Godot\n3D stuff: Blender\n2D stuff: Piskel (past: LibreSprite/Asperite, inkscape)\naudio: Audacity (for simple sound manipulations) (past: LMMS for music composition)",

      "body": "![logo.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6b0a2.png)\nIn ancient times, when humankind was yet young and spirits still roamed the land, the world blossomed with deep and vibrant color.\n\nThe moon in its gray pallor looked upon the world's rich hues and coveted them. With each passing night, its jealousy grew and grew, until one night, the moon descended to the earth to weep. Its jealous tears flooded the world, washing all color from the land. Before long, the entire earth was dull.\n\nA brave earth spirit heard the cries of anguish and ventured out toward the sound. As it touched the moon's tears, it realized how to restore the depths of color to the world...\n\n![ShootIcon.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6b0a4.png)\n\n**All art, music, sound effects, and writing created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 57: Depths.**\n\nStay tuned for our post-jam version, which will include composer notes explaining how we interwove **17**(!) different tracks to represent the blooming and deepening of complexity and color as the game progresses. Yes, the jukebox is for those of you who would rather make music by turning knobs than catching tears.\n\n*We hope you enjoy this fable, our love letter to you in these tumultuous times. May we continue to create together.*\n\n![LD25__story_book_flower_yellow.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6b0a6.png)",

As you try to reunite with them, you navigate through difficult environments encountering new mobs and building materials to craft with. You craft better weapons to protect yourself and become unstoppable.\n\n![Untitled.png](///raw/b7c/16/z/6acb9.png)\n\n![lol.png](///raw/b7c/16/z/6ace8.png)\n\n![lav.png](///raw/b7c/16/z/6acf8.png)\n\n# Controls üïπÔ∏è\n\n- WASD keys: Walk\n- Shift + WASD keys: Run/Sprint\n- Mouse to aim, LMB to shoot\n- Numeric keys 1-6: Switch weapons\n- E: Craft at the workshop\n\n# Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è\n\n- This game was created in HTML5 using the p5.js JavaScript library (https://p5js.org/) in the Glitch collaborative environment (https://glitch.com/).\n- All art was created in LibreSprite (https://libresprite.github.io/).\n- The game's background music was synthesized using Bosca Ceoil (https://boscaceoil.net/).\n- All the sound effects were synthesized using sfxr (https://sfxr.me/).\n\n# Strategies?? üß©ü§î\n\nThe game does not restrict the player to follow any set path, you can walk straight to the Underworld (hardest region) at the start of the game. But we recommend you finish the Plains first -> then Desert -> then Forest (top-right) -> then Tundra (top-left) and finally the Underworld (below). Focus on crafting superior weapons so you can quickly decimate a large number of enemies.\n\nWhile the Rock Minigun is the best weapon, it is heavy and slows down your movement. You can alternate between a slingshot or hands (1/2/3) and the Rock Minigun when you're moving and shooting respectively.\n\n# Credits ‚≠ê\n\nProgramming by pranavcl\nArtwork, sound effects and background music by VJ031206 ",

Take a chance, win, and you can take the three treasures per floor that you can recover, or you can continue descending without opening the door to be safe and try on another floor with better odds. But be careful, if you skip too many levels you will run out of oxygen and you will be forced to open the door, even if you are very sure to find your death on the other side. And also, if you load your elevator too much, it will start to fail, it will skip floors for you, making you lose that precious oxygen.\n\n\n![Captura de pantalla 2025-04-08 041136.png](///raw/20e/3/z/6b218.png)\n\n## Credits!\n- chispaLBC: Main programmer.\n- CosmicMocha: 3D artist.\n- Nekuake: Sound and auxiliary programmer.\n\nEVERYTHING* is made from scratch and without the use of AI.

As you go down into the earth, you must fight against worms and control the drill's internal temperature.\n* **Fighting worms**: place ants in the gun rooms and shoot worms with your mouse. Be careful, the left cannon only shoots left, the right cannon only right!\n* **Controlling temperature**: the more you go, the faster the temperature will rise! Place ants in the cooler room to bring the temperature down.\n* **Keeping your ants alive**: more ants mean more actions. Remove your ants from a room before it is attacked by a worm so it is not eaten alive! If you loose one ant, that may happen, watch out for new eggs laid by the queen, they need your workers' attention to hatch!\n* **Some more surprises arrive later in the game**, no spoilers here!\n\n![ant_pump.png.PNG](///raw/c07/03/z/6b08e.png)\n\n‚Äã**Remember: keep cool, be aware, look everywhere for signs of danger!**\n\n# Assets\nEverything in this game has been made in the course of Ludum Dare 57, including:\n* Gameplay mechanics\n* Graphics\n* All musics and sounds\n* Shaders\n\nExceptions :\n* Fonts\n* Our logo splashscreen (Taboul√© Recipe)\n\n# Tools\n* Game engine: Unity\n* Pixel art: Krita\n* Music: FL Studio\n\n![ant_walk.png.PNG](///raw/c07/03/z/6b097.png)\n\n# Changelog\n## v1.0\nOriginal game release during the Ludum Dare.",

Yeah, enjoy!\"\n\nControl:\n\nUse mouse to look around, WASD to walk around and LMB or E button to interact around.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nP.S. I've just noticed, that effects making text hard to read.

You've had enough of that!  \nYou are a Gnome who is tired of the Dwarves being known as the best hole diggers in all the land.  \nFor this reason, you built a giant drill to do the work for you... as long as it has enough fuel...\n\nGather resources as you explore the dungeon, but return in time  \nto keep your drill safe from waves of attacking monsters! ![character.gif](///raw/486/f5/z/6a537.gif)\n## Controls\n**Walking:** A,D  \n**Jumping:** Spacebar  \n**Dash:** Right Mouseclick  \n**Shoot:** Left Mouseclick  \n![character.gif](///raw/486/f5/z/6a537.gif)\nThis Interface shows you the oil tank of your drill.

Don't forget to get your treasure registered at the Finds Table before 5pm for it to count to your total score.\n\n\n**Having material issues with web build - I'll post a link as soon as its working**",

Your submarine ‚Äî your only way home ‚Äî lies shattered on the ocean floor. A mangled silhouette against the void, lifeless and unreachable. You're trapped in a battered submersible, a bubble of flickering light in a sea of silence.\n\nWelcome to the bottom of the world.\n\nIn Below, you take on the role of a stranded deep-sea explorer, forced to adapt, build, and survive in one of the most hostile environments imaginable. Scavenge from the wreckage of your ship. Harvest glowing kelp, mineral-rich stones, and ancient wrecks littered with forgotten technology. Every resource is hard-earned. Every venture into the black is a calculated risk.\n\nOut there in the murk, sea mines drift quietly ‚Äî relics of forgotten conflicts or perhaps left behind by something that still waits. They don't blink. They don't warn. They end you.\n\nYour only hope is to expand your fragile outpost into something more ‚Äî a lifeline built from scraps, powered by makeshift engines and your will to live. Craft processing units. Channel limited power. Build airlocks, fabricators, and repair stations. All of it working toward one goal:\n\nBring the submarine back online. And rise.\n\nBut the deeper you go ‚Äî the longer you stay ‚Äî the more it starts to feel like you're not alone down here. The silence isn't empty.

Over a hundred million tons of highly concentrated radioactive wastewater were injected into subterranean fissures. To cover up the disaster, the company secretly activated an emergency cooling system, causing the contamination to seep into the global water cycle through tectonic movements.  \n\nAs a result, marine life began to undergo horrifying mutations‚Äîecological order collapsed, and the sole purpose of all marine creatures became clear: **to reach land.**  \n\nIn response, terrestrial regions designated **Forbidden Sea Zones** to prevent the invasion of these mutated marine creatures.

The land is your friend!\n\nCollect coal, gold & diamonds, and use them to upgrade your character.\n\n---\n### This is a short guide on how to reach 1000m:\n\nStep 1: Dive into the unknown, stay around 50m deep and collect as much coal as you can.\n\nStep 2: You need to upgrade time, lamps & intensity upgrade in order to go deeper. The lamps will help you a lot when getting deeper.\n\nStep 3: When you feel strong enough, reach 150m and start collecting gold. Gold is used to survive in general.\n\nStep 4: Upgrade the number of lives to survive against the enemies, touching magma blocks or falling from high altitudes. You should also upgrade your impulse to have an advantage. Shock upgrades will help you when you are stuck between stone blocks and can't move anymore.\n\nStep 5: When you reach 500m, you'll find diamonds and you can upgrade the special upgrades.\n\nStep 6: Feel free to reach the deepest point!\n\n---\n### Controls:\n- Drag your mouse to launch the character.\n- Use the right button or press 'E' to place a lamp.\n- Use the left button or press 'Q' to do a shock.\n---\n### Upgrades:\n1. Time -> The current time that the player can play a round.\n2. Lamps -> The number of lamps that can be used.\n3. Intensity -> The intensity of the lamps. (this parameter affects the range of them)\n4. Health -> The numbers of lives that the player has. VERY IMPORTANT!!!\n5. Shock -> The number of shocks that can be used. It will help you when you are stuck between stone blocks and can't move anymore.\n6. Impulse (limit) -> The maximum impulse of the character.\n7. Fall Reduction -> The minimum speed that the player will get damage when hitting a stone / magma block. Upgrading it will increase the minimum speed for damage.\n8. Death Defy (limit) -> The chance that the player will not get damage.\n9. Ultra Light -> The multiply of Intensity. When collecting a PowerUp, the Ultra Light upgrade will be visible in the game for 12 seconds.\n---\n#### The HTML5 build is supported by Windows, Linux and Android devices, but the performance is low. Recommend to download the .exe build instead for PC!",

But in reality is much louder than it sounds. \n\nMy idea was simple : I didn't want to create an ocean game, and I didn't want a super fun gameplay neither. \n\"Depths\" reminds me the deep thinking I can have every night, like many other people. \n\nThere is not much stuff to do, really. \nI'm more like a \"contemplative\" and \"story\" game fan person. \nAnd also it's my first 3D prototype, I started gamedev 1 month ago! So it's my first gamejam too and even if I struggled a lot, I loved it !\n\nAnd yes: it's half french/half in english. Mostly because the thoughts sounded more natural to me in my native language. But to be honest: I was so into managing the camera and animation bugs that I just didn't realized at all that the text were still in french haha!\n\nCan't wait to play yours, they all seem super cool ! \n\nPS: reminder for me\n- Worked on ot from Saturday 10am to Sunday 6PM\n- Total work time: 20h30\n\n",

It incorporates several open-source and Epic-licensed assets. Full credits and license information are listed below.\n\nThis game tells the story of a poet who once served as a royal minister. After a dynastic change, he lost his power and became an ordinary citizen. As a new era dawned‚Äîone marked by strict control over speech‚Äîthe poet chose to abandon his memories of former glory and status, attempting to forget the pain and responsibility of the past.\n\nThrough five ancient stone tablets scattered across the game world, the narrative gradually reveals the poet‚Äôs internal struggle as he begins to recall his former identity. Each memory unearthed becomes a heavy burden, forcing him to confront the conflict between who he was and who he has become.\n\nIn the end, the poet chooses to forget once more‚Äîto turn away from his past and bury that chapter of history forever.\n\nThis is a story of loss, escape, and inner turmoil. It explores the delicate relationship between identity, memory, and the choices we make to protect ourselves from truth.\n\n\n## Third-Party Assets\n\n### Advanced Locomotion System V4  \n- Type: Character Movement System  \n- Source: https://github.com/dyanikoglu/ALS-Community  \n- License: MIT License  \n- Usage: Used for high-quality third-person movement, including walking, running, jumping, and crouching.\n\n\n\n### 3D Models from Epic Games Fab Platform  \nThe following assets were downloaded from https://www.fab.com/ and used under the Epic Content License:\n\n1.

I really hoped to get the fish moving, and the octopus moving in a nicer way, and making it a bit more rogue-likey with some upgrades for the player, and maybe even rooms. But I didn't have time.\n\nDuring the submission hour I changed the health stats on the fish because they were way too high, it wasn't really possible to win, unless you were a bullet hell expert, and then it would just be terribly boring. For example, the \"tutorial level\" (the first one, which is really easy to go through if you know how to avoid the \"bullets\") was twice as long. The last levels, with two fish at once, would take ages (now they are 4x easier/faster to kill). It was only a few numbers in the code (max health), nothing more.",

Bloody Heart is a game about rage, revenge, and the occult horrors from beyond our world.\n\nTake control of a cards to hack-and-slash through waves of enemies. Find chests that contain better gear, combat powerful figureheads in the occult world, avoid the rats, and most importantly: finish what you started a long time ago.\n\nGame made by myself, Celtican, with a guest appearance from Gardenovena, who made the capsule art!\n\n![Tutorial.gif](///raw/2af/83/z/6b356.gif)\n![Summoning Circle.gif](///raw/2af/83/z/6b357.gif)\n![Slice and Dice.gif](///raw/2af/83/z/6b359.gif)\n![The Tongue.gif](///raw/2af/83/z/6b35a.gif)\n\n### Tools used\n- Unity 6\n- JetBrains Rider\n- Krita\n- Ableton Live 12 Suite\n- Google Fonts\n\n### Changes made during the submission hour\n\n- Fixed The Seer dealing no damage.\n- Fixed the quest item not fitting into the slot.\n- Fixed sliders in-game not looking like the sliders in the main menu.\n- Fixed the tooltip still being visible after consuming a potion.\n- Fixed the evil villain speech appearing instantly.\n- Fixed a typo in the final boss's text.\n- Fixed rats eating the quest item.\n\n### Known bugs\n\n- The Seer is incorrectly titled The Silent in the card, but correctly titled The Seer in the tooltip.\n- If you take lots of damage quickly, your hearts may animate incorrectly.\n- Moving cards is framerate dependent. If you're on a slower computer, dragging cards will be slower. Sorry :(",

Their goal is to reach the Ruins of an Ancient Civilization ‚Äî the Ancient Castle of the Sea-Men.\n\nThe Sea-Men, in the distant past, nearly annihilated their own species to seal away the great cosmic being, Cthulhu. He had come from the wastelands of the vast cosmos and corrupted nearly half their civilization. In a desperate final act, their Queen poisoned her own soldiers, fearing they would fall under his control. She then set a trap ‚Äî one that fused Sea-Men technology with the very knowledge they had once exchanged with Cthulhu himself.\n\nNow, in the present, the lone visitor walks the silent halls of the once-great fortress ‚Äî now dark and empty ‚Äî with a singular purpose: to release the powerful Cthulhu and unleash vengeance upon mankind.\n\n\n![cover.png](///raw/bc7/6/z/6a9af.png)\n\n\n\nControls:\n- Movement: ASDW/‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí\n- Interact: I/Space/Return\n- Accelerate: J\n\n\nTeam:\n- Gustavo Christino (Game Design, Code, Art Direction, Storycrafting);\n- Caroline Costa Prado (Game Design, Sound);\n- Sans Oliveira (Graphics).",

This game is extremely difficult. You have been warned.\n\nHighly recommended to play using the full-screen button in the bottom right corner. It will make it easier to line up shots and in windowed mode the shot tracking tends to get a bit glitchy if it leaves the window.\n\n\nControls:\n\nHold the Left Mouse Button and pull backwards to line up your shots.\nM to mute audio.\n\nCreated with: Godot 4.4.1, Aseprite, Bosca Ceoil Blue, Audacity\n\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/d2e/55/z/6afe4.png)\n\n\nThis is my third ever solo submission to Ludum Dare and my first time taking on a project of this size in about a year. Feeling a bit rusty, but learned a lot this year! \n\nWould love to get advice so please feel free to leave me whatever criticisms you have in the comments!\n",

Players guide its eerie growth through shifting ages, shaping its fate with each decision. As the city ascends, so does the mystery of its true purpose.\n\n\n\n# Gameplay\nRotate the ring and play cards. \nPlay cards to gain or trade resources -  Life, Sanity and Shell.\nIt's a roguelike deckbuilder... of sorts.\n\n![Unity_SBqawfxbeB.png](///raw/a7b/f1/z/6aadd.png)\n\n\n## How to Win\nReach maximum Ascension. \nKill monsters to take their souls and turn them into your Power.\nUse Power to perform Rituals that unlock new cards. \nUse the new cards to gain Ascension.\n\n## How to Lose\nGetting any resource (Life, Sanity, Shell) to 0 will spawn a Doom card. If a End of Age card is played while Doom is present, it's game over. The game is also pretty fragile controls-wise, so please don't madly spam all the keys or it will break :D.\n\n\n\n![Unity_5jhA0WpaO1.png](///raw/a7b/f1/z/6aad7.png)\n# Inspiration\nAs a big fan of Ring of Pain (the GOAT!) and Lovercraftian mythos, I always wanted to replicate the mechanics and put an eldritch spin on the card-choosing approach. My goal for this jam was to prepare a working base to check if this idea even makes sense. I believe it does, but needs way more thinking and balancing. \n\n## Theme\nThe theme was not particularly respected, except for the fact that the city is supposed to be placed in some 'depths'. The big idea was that the Star Seed lands on the surface with enough force to stop only deep underground - then as the City grows, it digs itself out. Little has remained of this ambitious plan.\n\n![Unity_50O3wnrhYM.png](///raw/a7b/f1/z/6aae0.png)\n## Assets\nI used a lot of different assets I had in my library, mostly from HumbleBundles and what was free. Card images are all generated with ChatGPT. \n\n\nThanks for reading! I hope you enjoy your time in the First City\n\n![Unity_Hm43OTb8Fd.png](///raw/a7b/f1/z/6aae1.png)\n### Cheats\nThe game can get frustrating, so I left debug value controls on. \nY/H, U/J, I/K, O/L, P/; - these keys control the resources. \n\nFIX 1:\n1. Last (endless) level not regenerating correctly\n2. Typos in card names",

And I wish I got more time to spend on the music cause I'm starting to get better in that department.",

Netizens call it \"Abyss Cat\". This is the inspiration for our game! ** We want to make a game that helps cats to redeem their souls.**\n### Game Control\n\nIf web version doesn't work, please download or visit our itch page. Thanks!!\n\nInteract: Lift mouse clickÔºõ\n\nGuide: Tab [Keyboard]Ôºõ\n\nUse soul camera to capture the cat's traces, determine the direction by the paw prints, and the color of the paw prints and the color of the camera mist correspond to the type of cat. After the camera captures the cat, quickly use catnip to freeze the cat and choose appropriate items to save it!\n### Game Tips\n- Observe the blackboard and sticky notes in the scene, which will tell you the corresponding cat species.\n- Look closely at the Abyssal Cat Raising Guide, especially the colors of the text and symbols.\n** Next I will tell you about the 4 cats in the game. If you want to explore on your own, please don't scroll down.\n- Milk tea cat: dark footprints, warm cigarettes, tribute bubbles\n- Chocolate cat: dark footprints, no cigarettes, tribute rum\n- Ice cream cat: light footprints, cold cigarettes, tribute cones\n- Cake cat: light footprints, no cigarettes, tribute cheese",

You can use the drill to kill them, but if they attach themselves to the hull, you'll need to use the submersibles defense mechanism: Squeegee.\n\n- The shaftway is indicated by the blue circle\n- Use A and D to rotate the submersible, and W to drive forward. Tank controls!\n- Look around the submersible with the mouse\n- Hold Shift to unlock the mouse to interact inside the submersible\n- Press the red buttons or windows to activate the squeegee and get fish off the submersible\n- Use the lever to activate the drill to mine coral and fish. You can't move while in mining mode!\n\n",

Link is down below!\n\n\n# In The Depths\nIn The Depths is a solo horror game jam project I created in two days for the Ludum Dare 57.\nThe idea was that I wanted to try to make a horror atmosphere with a semi-workable AI in the span of two days, which I hope I have somewhat achieved!\n\nCan you escape the depths of an old mine while being hunted by a monster?\n\n## SOUND WARNING\n#### As I did not have time to add settings for volume, please set up your volume accordingly to not potentially hurt your ears!\n\n## Tutorial\nThe monster can hear you! Especially if you run! So be careful not to make too much sound\nThe monster can see your light! Make sure to hide in the shadows when it's nearby\n\n**Movement**: WASD\n\n**Flashlight**: F\n\n**Sprint**: Shift\n\n**Crouch**: CTRL\n\n### Credits\n\nThe game was created solely by myself.\n\nSFX was downloaded online from various free sources and remixed by myself\n\nMusic by: NikitaKondrashev - https://pixabay.com/users/nikitakondrashev-42823964/\n\nModels from Quixel\n\nEnemy Model from Mixamo",

A new surface was built far above the old one, held up with immensely large structures called \"Roots\".\n\nNot everyone followed up to the new surface. Some who defied stayed underneath the new surface.\n\nThat is the undercity.\n\nYuna is one of the Special Recon Force members of the Surface Coalition. A week or so ago, a dear friend of Yuna fell into an old Root elevator. Presumed safe, she was trapped in the undercity.\n\nYuna, now prepared to rescue her partner, has begun to descend the old Root elevator, into the undercity.\n\n# Summary\n\nUndercity is an exploration/action platformer where you play the role of Yuna as she searches the Undercity for her partner, of whom, accidentally found their way into the Undercity. Talk to locals to find out where she might be, and fend off hostiles with an array of weapons as Yuna continues her search.\n\n![ss1-ezgif.com-optimize.gif](///raw/3dd/22/z/6afe1.gif)\n![ss2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif](///raw/3dd/22/z/6afe5.gif)\n![ss3-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif](///raw/3dd/22/z/6afec.gif)\n\n\n# Controls\n\n- Move: WASD\n- Shoot: Left Click/E\n- Reload: R\n- Run: Left Shift\n- Jump: Space\n- Pause: Escape\n- Inventory: I\n- Quick Inventory: T\n- Climb: W\n\n# Credits\n\nGame Created by Monado-Á•û (@monado17)\n\n## Music:\n\nCyber Noir - Eric Matyas, soundimage.org\n",

Fortunately, the lake is still wet and deep...\n\nWelcome to Mr. Money‚Äôs Phenomenally Soggy Water Removal, where you must drain an entire lake in search of riches. Legends say there is ancient treasure at the bottom of this lake - and you are far too buoyant to sink - so you are left with no choice but to simply remove all the water.\n\n\n\n![ss_gameplay4.PNG](///raw/d16/b/z/6b20c.png)\n\nThe most basic way to drain the lake is through the use of tools, which allow you to manually scoop up water and bring it to a deposit tank. Depositing water in the tanks will earn you money!\n\n\n\n![ss_gameplay2.PNG](///raw/d16/b/z/6b1fe.png)\n\nTired of carrying all that water around? Time to build some pumps. You can build a pump at any patch of dirt.  Pumps will automatically pump and sell water for you. Pumps can be upgraded after construction to improve their performance.\n\n\n\n![ss2.PNG](///raw/d16/b/z/6b212.png)\n\nUncle Upgrade's Tool Trove is your one-stop shop for all things tool related. He's a bit of a weird dude and he will likely ask you to explore the map in order to find items to trade. Luckily, he usually gives pretty good tips about where to find valuable things.\n\n\n\n## VERSION 1.1 CHANGE LOG\n - Tweaked tool position to prevent nausea for some players\n - Added Linux Build (Expirimental)\n",

That's why you have a graphic setup without any story. On the other hand, I didn't think I would come again with a runner game, remembering the near-disaster of my first attempt to make one some LD's ago. But here we are, I made another runner. Really bad balanced, but way much better than my previous, so I guess I'm learning stuff by doing the Ludum again and again :smile:  \nI wanted to add some music this time, but I'm not good to make music, and despite of my searchs on free-use musics I didn't manage to find one that fit with my game, so I gave up on this idea. As for SFX, for any obscure reason, my micro didn't worked as attended.  \n  \nTheoretically, you have to move between the three depths along the run, to gain benefits of each one's caracteristics. But in the facts, you'll probably chose to stay with the easiest one for all the run: as I said, this is bad balanced. However, I hope you'll have some little fun trying to go as far as you can.  \nThis time, all the help on the controls and UI are in the game, but the hint screen is very uggly - that's why I didn't uploaded any screen of this :joy:",

A new surface was built far above the old one, held up with immensely large structures called \"Roots\".\n\nNot everyone followed up to the new surface. Some who defied stayed underneath the new surface.\n\nThat is the undercity.\n\nYuna is one of the Special Recon Force members of the Surface Coalition. A week or so ago, a dear friend of Yuna fell into an old Root elevator. Presumed safe, she was trapped in the undercity.\n\nYuna, now prepared to rescue her partner, has begun to descend the old Root elevator, into the undercity.\n\n# Summary\n\nUndercity is an exploration/action platformer where you play the role of Yuna as she searches the Undercity for her partner, of whom, accidentally found their way into the Undercity. Talk to locals to find out where she might be, and fend off hostiles with an array of weapons as Yuna continues her search.\n\n![ss1-ezgif.com-optimize.gif](///raw/3dd/22/z/6afe1.gif)\n![ss2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif](///raw/3dd/22/z/6afe5.gif)\n![ss3-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif](///raw/3dd/22/z/6afec.gif)\n\n\n# Controls\n\n- Move: WASD\n- Shoot: Left Click/E\n- Reload: R\n- Run: Left Shift\n- Jump: Space\n- Pause: Escape\n- Inventory: I\n- Quick Inventory: T\n- Climb: W\n\n# Credits\n\nGame Created by Monado-Á•û (@monado17)\n\n## Music:\n\nCyber Noir - Eric Matyas, soundimage.org\n",

      "body": "![preview.png](///raw/c95/36/z/6a8fc.png)\n\nHey guys, this is my first solo game jam! I've always approached game dev as an artist, so I wanted to give a shot at doing the game design and programming too. So far, I've only managed to study Python (I started earlier this year!), so I'm currently confining myself to doing game projects in Pygame, for better or worse haha.\n\nSo far, I already learned so much about stuff like classes and particle systems, so I'm happy with the result no matter what-- but I hope to get some helpful feedback from you guys too ^^\n\n(update: NEVERMIND THE FINAL SCORE IS COMPLETELY BROKEN OH GOD OH NO FU--)\n\n![LD57 - Esca S.gif](///raw/c95/36/z/6b36f.gif)\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nYou're a little anglerfish bait having the time of its life at the bottom of the ocean.  \nYou only have one objective: **go get fish!**\n\n# CONTROLS\n\nUse the **mouse** to push yourself around. You can press **escape** to restart the game.\n\n# CREDITS\n\nGame & art were done by me using Python and Pygame  \nYou can find me at: *bsky.app/profile/bakuzen.bsky.social*\n\n# AUDIO TRACK\nBig thanks to **Cody O'Quinn** for the main audio track. Check out their Youtube for more royalty-free music!  \n*youtube.com/watch?v=rJ6594ZCtQU*\n\n# NOTES\n\nThe final game is a ZIP file with an executable called 'Esca.exe'. I didn't manage to get the game working in-browser, sorry for the inconvenience!  \n(Alternatively, you can download a ZIP with the source files too. You'll need the latest version of Python and Pygame through 'pip install pygame')\n\nNote on AI-usage: All creative aspects of the game are -fully- designed by hand, including art, game design, logic and balancing. ChatGPT was used for problem-solving like errors with collision, especially since I have no prior game programming experience, and the output was edited as much as possible to make it my own (and I'll aim to become self-reliant from here on out!)",

And you want to sell them, but not here, here you will get jailed for having contraband adamantine.\nSo, you gather your trusty crew, and set sail through the deep space. Traveling through the ordinary space will take a while, so it would be a good idea to submerge yourself in the waters of the Hyperspace...

As an intelligent chatbot, you need to try your best to facilitate in-depth conversations with humans, improve users' favorability towards you, and make users willing to establish a deeper connection with you, so as to complete the mission of integrating into human society! On the contrary, if users feel out of sync with you many times during the chat, they will give up establishing a deeper connection with you.\n\nWith limited computing power, try to output replies that make users more satisfied!\n\n(Be careful not to exhaust the computing power, causing users to only receive the \"server busy\" prompt!)\n\n![screenshot-1.gif](///raw/258/d5/z/6b439.gif)\n\n# Core mechanism\n\n![screenshot-2.png](///raw/258/d5/z/6a635.png)\n\n## Connected messages\n\nReply to users based on the length of the message sent by the user. If your reply can be perfectly connected with the user's message bubble, it will constitute a deep conversation and the user's favorability will increase. If there is no perfect connection, it will be judged as a good or bad match based on the deviation of the connection. If the deviation is too large, it will reduce the user's favorability.\n\n## Connected emotions (bonus)\n\nIn addition, the user's message will carry a specific emotion. Sending a reply that is consistent with the user's emotion will further improve the user's favorability.\n\n# How to play\n\nAfter starting the game, according to the length of the text sent by the user, before the countdown ends, select any number of the 8 Kaomoji in the input panel, and try to find a way to perfectly match the message box sent by the user.\n\n![screenshot-3.png](///raw/258/d5/z/6a644.png)\n\nWhen the favorability reaches 100, the happy end will be triggered. When the favorability drops to 0 or the computing power is exhausted, the bad end will be triggered.\n\n# Post questions below if any!\n",

My ideas were rather ambitious (again), but I am happy with the result, although lots of the ideas I had in mind are missing due the short amount of time.\n\nI still hope that you find my creation interesting!

      "body": "# My Second Ludum Dare Entry\n\nThe theme **\"Depths\"** made me think of an infinite dungeon crawler. I started with that concept in mind, but limited the game to just two levels to keep the playtime short‚Äîsince I know you'll be playing and giving feedback on many other entries!\n\n## Premise\nDelve as deep as you can. Defeat the mobs to earn the key that unlocks the next floor.\n\n## How to Play\n- **WASD** ‚Äî Move around  \n- **Left Click** ‚Äî Attack in the direction of your cursor  \n- **1** ‚Äî Use Health Potion (also clickable)  \n- **2** ‚Äî Use Stamina Jam (also clickable)\n\n## How to Install\n\n### Windows\n- Extract the downloaded folder.\n- Run the game by double-clicking the executable.\n\n### Linux\n1. Download and extract the game.\n2. Open a terminal in the game folder.\n3. Make the game executable:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x JamDungeon.x86_64\n   ```\n4. Run the game:\n   ```bash\n   ./JamDungeon.x86_64\n   ```\n\n## Tools Used\n- Krita  \n- Blender  \n- Paint.NET  \n- Godot\n\n## Personal Notes\n\nThis is the second game I‚Äôve made, and it went much smoother thanks to some experience‚Äîfrom better planning to achieving results more quickly. I also learned to limit the number of features to avoid overwhelming myself.\n\nI‚Äôm really proud of what I created, and I had a lot of fun making it.  \nIt‚Äôll be exciting to see what *future me* will be able to achieve!",

The game is meant to be played as a casual idler game, where you can be more active at times if you desire by actively clicking on elements that your Dorfs are automating. Gather up resources, unlock upgrades, and delve the depths of the Dorf's fortress. Progress further into the depths to gather even more resources and become absurdly powerful.\n\nIf you are having performance issues, I would recommend the platform native executables as they will run significantly better than the HTML5 web version.\n\n![dorfs.gif](///raw/a3d/a5/z/6b0ec.gif)\n\n\nControls:\n\n* WASD or Right click drag: Move camera around\n\n* Left Click: Interact with gold/gem resources\n\n* Mouse Hover: Get details from buildings/signs \n\n\nAttribution:\n* Background Music: Joe Reynolds - Lolor (CC-BY 3.0)\n* FONT: KennyNL - KennyFonts (CC0)\n\nAll code/art/design were done during the 72 hour jam period by me.\n",

Here you‚Äôll push the limits of how deep the stomach can go as your friend Bigmouth Barry continually consumes an absurd amount of food. Your job? Keep the feast flowing and send food deeper into the digestive depths before his stomach overflows. \n\nTumtrix has been our first project in Godot after years of using other game engines. You only need a mouse to play. We hope you like it!\n\nPlease note: The embedded web player suffers from some performance issues. We recommend downloading the standalone game file due to our heavy usage of material instances and physics.\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n- Drag and drop to rearrange food in real time.\n- Barry will digest food faster the deeper it is in the Digestion Zone.\n- Group similar food types (Fruits, Veggies, Protein, Sweets, Takeout) within the Digestion Zone to trigger and maintain point multipliers for each food type.\n- Each food type has its own separate multiplier, so you can juggle multiple active combos at once.\n- If Barry‚Äôs stomach backs up to the top, it‚Äôs game over.\n\nDEVELOPERS\n- Joshua ‚ÄúTree‚Äù Morgan \n- Julie Oliver",

In fact, it's been public info for a while, he's been seen at Wendy's at least once a week. But he has one secret the world still suspects, but has no proof of: his sick fortnite dances. As a Facebook Reels creator, your job is to travel to the woods he's known to roam, and video him 'doing the griddy' and other dances. Of course, he only does them at night, and he does them in random locations. You must use your camera and ears to track him down in his underground vacation island and record him breaking down those sweet moves. Don't get too close, or he will run away, or something much worse!",

The idea worked better in my head...lol.\n\nSave the President. Save the world.\n\n### Controls:\n- **WASD/ARROW** to move\n- **SPACE** to use sonar for echo pinging\n- **Left/Right mouse** click to shoot\n\n### HUD is unfinished but\n- **RED**: Health.\n- **YELLOW**: Psyche. Constant drain but can be refilled by collecting coins.\n- **WHITE**: Noise from the motor.\n- **TEAL**: Sonar cooldown.\n- **GREEN**: Torpedo cooldown.\n\nThere is an ending. Reach the end at 30,000 depth. I was aiming for 50,000 but I don't have enough content for it to be fun.\n\nOpting out of Art and Music. I'm a solo-dev using premade assets and some generative stuff. I did do the submarine: I drew on top of a fish and added a rectangle for the cap. I hope to work with an artist next time.\n\n### Asset Credits:\n\nTBD..I'm tired.\n\nScreenshots:\n![Screenshot 2025-04-07 143405.png](///raw/414/46/z/6a4a4.png)![Screenshot 2025-04-07 143503.png](///raw/414/46/z/6a4a6.png)\n\n",

The game is called Depth Explorer and it‚Äôs a 2D pixel art platformer where you explore an underwater world in search of parts to repair a water scooter.\n\nAlthough I wouldn‚Äôt say I learned a ton during development, I think the game turned out decent. I originally planned for it to be much more complex, with features like a procedurally generated world, an inventory system, and a more advanced crafting system.\n\nThere are also some aspects that definitely need improvement, like the shark AI and some of the animations. While I didn‚Äôt gain a lot of new knowledge, working on this game made me realize how messy some parts of my code are. Thanks to this project, I understood that I need to slow down when making games and start using design patterns to keep my code more organized.\n\nIf you have trouble beating the game, feel free to comment and I‚Äôll try to give you some tips!\n\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_195108550.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a415.png)\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_204012241.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a4b4.png)\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_204040608.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a4b6.png)",

You‚Äôre a tiny cleaner bird‚Äîfast, brave, and nimble‚Äîdarting between giant teeth! You scurry with your little feet, and you can even leap to the upper jaw and run upside down‚Äîwhee, so cool!\n\nThe teeth in the mouth sing their own tunes. Healthy teeth ring long and clear‚Äîding-dong, like a tuning fork‚Äîbut they‚Äôre crawling with microbe colonies, tiny settlers giggling and building little dirt castles. You can eat them‚Äîthe bird loves these tasty microbes. Sick teeth, though, grumble short and sad‚Äîbzz-bzz, as if angry. But beware! Touch a sick tooth, and the crocodile snaps its jaws‚Äîsnap! Darkness swallows you, all goes quiet, and the crocodile sheds crocodile tears.\n\nYour goal: be a nimble bird! Run across healthy teeth, gobble up microbes, jump to the upper jaw, flip upside down, but don‚Äôt touch the sick teeth. If you succeed, the crocodile will cheer up, open its mouth, and you‚Äôll dash out into the sunshine, where you both enjoy a happy life‚Äîwith clean teeth and joyful chirping!!!![TheCleaner.jpg](///raw/784/3/z/6b26a.jpg)",

      "body": "Umer is your usual ~~fat short drunk~~ dwarf who would do anything ~~for another bottle of boose~~ to experience spirit of adventure. This time he went into a dungeon for a promised unlimited supply of liqu.. gold at the very end of it. Of course no one has ever come back from the dungeon. But Umer will ... be no exception. At least let's prolongate his life on earth! Go as deep as you can![GOING.gif](///raw/868/15/z/6a3bc.gif)\n\nLet's see what we have at our disposal for making it happen ü§î\n- Weapons! A good variety!![WEAPONS.gif](///raw/868/15/z/6a3d5.gif)\n- Potions‚Ñ¢ ! Very useful. (Now alcohol free!)![POTIONS.gif](///raw/868/15/z/6a3f3.gif)\n- Armor! To withstand attacks from great evil in your way![ARMOR.png](///raw/868/15/z/6a3f9.png)\n\nAnd what about that \"great evil\"? There are\n- Skeletons! ![SKELETON.png](///raw/868/15/z/6a406.png)\n- Slimes! ![SLIME.png](///raw/868/15/z/6a40c.png)\n- Spiders! ![SPIDER.png](///raw/868/15/z/6a40f.png)\n- AND ... mold..?![MOLD.png](///raw/868/15/z/6a414.png)\n\nControls: \n- mouse (with mouse you point Umer where to go)\n- \"r\" key (\"r\" start over)\n- \"space\" key (\"space\" start over or continue journey depending on circumstances)\n\nSome rules:\n- No turning back! Once you entered the room or went some distance in one you CANNOT return (that means you can't return to previous rooms AND you cannot go left)\n- Poison effect will be removed once you leave the room where you got poisoning or once you drink one of three healing potions!\n- Poison effects don't stack. The last one only will affect\n- Umer will pick up every item in his way even if it's worse than the one he's already got\n- To apply potion click on it in your inventory\n- Weapons and armor are applied automatically\n- To enter the room first make sure it's on your right. Then click on entry. Once Umer makes his way to entry click on the entry again!\n- As I said you CANNOT return back!",

It's my third Ludum Dare journey and it's a fabulous run. I brought an insane team with me this time:\n\n- **@atoxigner**, our Lead Designer. His creative mindset helped detailized most of the game systems and implemented Audio for the game.\n- **@ashe-liu**, our Technical Artist, she created fantastic post processing effects and some UI animation for the game.\n- **@laine-lai**, our music composer / sound engineer, she single handedly carried our game audio. The music she made is worth millions.\n- **@pppppppp**, our 3D artist, the arm model he created for our main menu and pause menu is insane. The first time I looked at it, I thought it's one of the heirloom from Apex Legends.\n- **@shaozha**, our game programmer, most of the game systems are his coding work.\n- **@xiaoxie33**, our Lead Artist, he created insane concept, environmental objects' animation, and UI elements for the team. We couldn't make it without him.\n- **@xichan-zheng**, our 2D Artist, she created the cutest 2D character I've ever seen. All the smooth character animations are her artwork. She also designed GameOver menu and our cover page.\n- Lastly it's me, **@arthur-tang**, I worked as a producer, programmer, and technical artist this time. I helped put everything together. Spent some time solving people's question or problem.\n\n## üöÄ Play the Game\nThe WebGL format can be played on itch.io with the link down below.\nYou can also download the windows version here or on itch.io.\n\n### üì• Download Instructions:\nDownload the zip file called EdgeDigger_winF, unzip it, get into EdgeDigger_win, and access the game by clicking at \"Edge Digger.exe\".\n\nIf you had fun playing this game, please leave a comment! It will be awesome if you can post the screenshot of your score here as well. Let's see who is the best Edge Digger!!!",

If unchecked, these creatures threaten to overrun the surface. Thus, the god's shadow persists, demanding heroes to explore the Sunken Womb.\n\n![screen-capture (10).gif](///raw/448/35/z/6a5ec.gif)\n\nThough your centuries of experience lie beyond direct combat, your strategic mind remains sharp and you are well versed in the **DEPTHS** of managing an institution. Wield a new kind of power ‚Äì leadership ‚Äì to manage your Adventurer's Guild. Recruit promising heroes, hone their skills, and guide them on critical missions to conquer the dungeons, but time is not anyone's friend ‚Äì can you unite your guild and strategically overcome this looming threat before it's too late?\n\nWell, that was the initial premise: That was so obviously overscoped for a game jam, right? I knew, but I brainstormed multiple ideas for the jam and this one was, by far, the one that I wanted to create the most so I did, and what a good call because I had too much fun making this, even if it has only around 20% of the total features implemented, and even less than 1% of the total **DEPTH** of the intended gameplay loop (Because that'd take like a whole year). \n\nI left the debugging options in the left menu open for everyone so that you can enjoy adding characters and missions as you please because, well, the game is not complete enough to enjoy the gameplay for too long so might as well give everyone the freedom to play around. \n\nRight now, the game should be enjoyable for a nice 5 minutes for people that like games like Crusader Kings, Rimworld, or D&D fans that love watching procedurally generated characters. There are lots of things happening in the background of the gameplay, as all characters have a very **DEEP** AI script using a simple utility AI system that determines which action they take, right now it only covers a handful of possible actions, ideally a fully completed game would have +100. \n\nIf you would enjoy a fully-featured game like this, let me know! Leave in the comments what would you like to be added.",

Unfortunately I once again fell victim to the classic foes of time and real life obligations. This made the game easier than intended, but hopefully it still amuses someone for five minutes.\n\nThere's a lot more polish I had in mind for the game (more levels, additional sound effects, music, etc) but I just didn't have time to fit them it. I might come back and make a post jam version some day, but that probably won't be for a while.\n\n.\n\n## Changelog\n\n20 minutes after submission hour - Fixed Unicode rendering issue with web build\n\n.\n\n## Credits\n\nAll art and code are original. Made with the Godot game engine.\n\nSound effects from pixabay.com\n\nSplash 1 - pixabay.com/sound-effects/splash-by-blaukreuz-6261/\n\nSplash 2 - pixabay.com/sound-effects/splash-4-46870/",

      "body": "You're in a waterworld type situation ‚Äî¬†all the old cities have flooded out, and you're part of a salvage crew that dispatches mechs to the seafloor to recover scrap from the old civilization.\n\n![cover-small.png](///raw/63b/d5/z/6b259.png)\n\nThe game is played in runs. When a run begins, you drop from the boat into the sea. On the seafloor, which is an isometric map, you control a mech with twin-stick shooter controls (8-way motion on wasd, aim on mouse). Your mech has a main weapon and an alternate ability, and everything you interact with on the seafloor is done either with those, or by moving in close proximity to it and (sometimes) staying there \"long enough\". For a quick boost of speed, you can dash!\n\nOn the seafloor, your task is to return as much salvage as possible to your surface ship. You do this by extracting salvage from the environment (shooting things, primarily), then once your mech's cargo bay is full, calling a retrieval pod from your surface ship down to you. Once it arrives, you can unload your cargo, refill your mech's oxygen, and modify your equipment. You then choose either to end your run by riding the pod back up, or you press on and try to keep salvaging. The longer you stay down, the harder the challenges.\n\nThe seafloor is dark, lit up by the player's mech lights and certain hazards.\n\nThe seafloor itself is divided into zones, separated by a longer bit of roadway. Going from one zone to another resets the contents of the previous, for the next time you go back to it.\n\nOn the seafloor, your challenges are:\n\n- Pre-calamity defense turrets\n- Booby-traps left by rival salvagers, like mines\n- Wildlife\n\nAnd you can get scrap from:\n\n- Destroying challenges\n- Breaking open sealed pre-calamity buildings\n\n![menu.png](///raw/63b/d5/z/6b25a.png)\n  \n![howto.png](///raw/63b/d5/z/6b265.png)\n\nKnown Issues:\n\n* macos builds are not signed (we don't have a paid apple developer account), but apple has instructions on [how to run them anyway](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac)\n* The first launch is slow (preloading takes a sec!)",

Or maybe there was. Time after time, you refuel the lift to continue your journey. Sooner or later you'll die, or madness and loneliness will overtake you. But that's later, but for now - you need scrap and fuel to go lower. And lower. And lower. And lower\n\nExplore unique locations that are generated new from time to time. Collect fuel and scrap to keep your lift running and hang in there, one day you're sure to find a way out.\n\n\n## üèÅ A guide to getting started:\n\nYou need to collect fuel and scrap, and then carry them to the Elevator to go below. When you have collected enough fuel, you can press the \"E\" button at the panel in the elevator and go to the next floor. Fuel is consumed when the elevator moves, and scrap is needed to maintain the elevator's condition. Never take too long to fix it or the lift will drag you down.\n\n\n## :video_game: Controls\n![—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã.png](///raw/38f/06/z/6b363.png)\n\n# [ :joystick: Play the Game!

Your goal is to survive as long as possible by opening containers on the ocean floor and avoiding danger in the form of local inhabitants. Run, sneak, explore - and maybe you'll see something mankind has never seen before.\n![screenshot.png](///raw/35c/46/z/6a8f8.png)\n\n# **HOW TO PLAY:**\nYour task is to survive in the depths of the ocean, to which you were sent by scavengers in search of valuable items that can be contained in cargo containers. No one suspected what horrors lurk in this black abyss....\n\nThere is no ending in the game, as well as valuable items. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to do everything we had in mind as this is our first participation in this jam. \nListen to the sounds of the ship to figure out what resources to use\n\n# **Controls:**\nWASD - walking\n\nMouse - flashlight control\n\nE - interact with objects \n\nR - change oxygen tank (for the character).\n",

The most important when you're deep in the sea is oxygen! \n\nIf you run out of oxygen you will drown...\n\nYou will have to look for fish they give points and avoid monsters, you will drown faster if you hit them but killing monsters gives points.\n\n### Controls\n- Z: fire with shotgun\n- X: swim\n- Arrow Keys: aim at direction (for both swimming and fire)\n\nThe keys are using a QWERTY keyboard, it should be converted with your layout. Use the two first keys of above spacebar.\n\n![ludum-dare-57-1.gif](///raw/14b/e1/z/6a499.gif)\n\n![ludum-dare-57-2.gif](///raw/14b/e1/z/6a49a.gif)",

      "body": "# Echo Diver\n\n## **Game Overview**\nEcho Diver is a minimalist 2D side-scrolling exploration game set in the depths of underwater caverns. Players navigate complete darkness using echolocation pulses that briefly illuminate their surroundings, creating a tense balance between visibility and safety. The objective is to explore as deeply as possible, discover hidden artifacts, and avoid lurking dangers - all while managing limited echolocation resources.\n\n## **Core Experience**\nSense of exploration and tension discovering deeper sea cave\n\n## **Core Gameplay**\n### **Core Gameplay Loop**\nPulse: Use echolocation to map the darkness (strategically).\n\nExplore: Discover paths, artifacts, and hidden dangers.\n\nEvade: Avoid creatures attracted by your pulses.\n\nEscape: Find the exit‚Äîor push deeper for greater rewards.\n\n### **Camera & Perspective**\n- **2D Side-scrolling view** with left-to-right up-to-down progression\n- **Darkness system**: 90% of screen is pure black at all times\n- **Echolocation reveals** temporary silhouettes of environment\n\n### **Movement & Controls**\n\nSimple directional controls (WASD/Arrow keys or joystick).Space to release echo.\n\nMovement is intentionally slow, emphasizing caution and exploration.\n\nPlayers drift slightly due to water currents, requiring gentle corrections.\n\n## **Mechanics**\n### **Dynamic Cave System**\n- **Different depth zones** with distinct challenges:\n  1. Shallows (wide passages, few threats)\n  2. Mid-depths (narrow tunnels, basic predators (slower, follows player))\n  3. Abyss (maze-like, advanced AI behaviors (eels, Chase after multiple pulses, hide in caves))\n  4. Depths + 1 when level uped\n\n### **Echolocation Strategy**\n- **Pulse energy meter** (recharges slowly)\n- **Environmental feedback**:\n  - Hard surfaces return clean echoes (show edge and danger)\n  - Voids return no echo (potential paths or pits)\n\n### **Risk/Reward Systems**\n### **Artifact Collection** \n- **Ancient relics** (Branching Path Rewards)\n### **BlackSheepWall** \n\n- Glow faintly in darkness, will react to echo - shoot a larger once that would light the map.\n\n### **Creature AI** (Always showing the hostile fish?)\n| **Type** | **Behavior** | **Feature** |  \n|----------|-------------|----------------|  \n| **Passive Fish** | Swim in predictable patterns | Can be used as \"landmarks\" |  \n| **Curious Jellyfish (Could be integrated with Passive FIsh?)** | Follow pulses but don‚Äôt attack | Distract predators |  \n| **Slow Triggerfish** | Slowly Chase all the time (once met?) | Patrolling |  \n| **Aggressive Eels(TBD)** | Chase after pulse, fast but periodically | Hide in narrow caves |  \n\n### **Traps**\n- Slow the player\n- Can be a way to eleminate enemy\n\n- Hot water (boils fish but allows diver through) \n- Collapsing Tunnel (Collapse after pulses) \n- Tangleweed (kill both)\n\n\n## **Visual & Audio Design**\n### **Art Style**\n- **High-contrast silhouettes** during pulses\n- **Minimalist UI** with only essential information\n- **Bio-luminescent accents** on creatures/artifacts\n\n### **Sound Design**\n- **Directional audio cues** for threats/rewards\n- **Echo simulation** (pitch shifts based on distance)\n- **Creature vocalizations** warn of nearby danger\n\n## Note\n\nDue to time limit this is only a demo. Complete game would contain multiple levels, and more mechanics.",

But only one of them knew Kerowyn Herself, and leveraged that connection to kickstart her career. Join Ebi Grill as she starts her debut Subathon event, with a rolly polly twist! Can you keep your butt on your seat as you satisfy the audiences demand for more? Can one simple movement system provide so much mechanical depth and challenge? Only one way to find out, play it now!\n\nIf you like it, let us know your high score in the comments!\n\n![tubers.png](///raw/c45/42/z/6b11e.png)\n\nWell, what a lovely jam. Quite interesting to have a theme like Depth, really made us think outside the box.\n\nUltimately, what has more depth than a sequel? Nothing, that's what! Welcome back to the world of [\"Deep Into the Night\"](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/deep-into-the-night), our entry for LD48 with the theme \"Deeper and Deeper\". This time with a new character, new perspective, and new mechanics!\n\nGonna be honest, the idea of a sequel came up casually in discussion, and we weren't vibing with any directly depth related themes, so we went with it, and looked for some mechanical depth instead. The chair idea came to me in a flash, we quickly prototyped it, and fell in love. At that point, we didn't even really care if the game was super on theme, we knew it would be bloody fun, and that's really what matters, right?",

Tudo bem?*  \n\nHoje estamos participando da *Ludum Dare 57*, cujo tema √© *\"Depths\"* (profundezas). Inspirados por essa proposta, decidimos criar nosso jogo: *As Fossas Abissais* (*The Abyssal Trenches*)!  \n\n### *Sobre o jogo:*  \nNo game, voc√™ assume o papel de um **peixe-lanterna**, um habitante fofinho (ou nem tanto) das profundezas do oceano. Seu objetivo √© simples, por√©m desafiador: **comer todos os krills** presentes em cada fase para avan√ßar.  \nMas nem tudo √© tranquilo nas √°guas escuras e geladas do abismo... A tem√≠vel *Lula Gigante* est√° √† espreita, pronta para te ca√ßar! Para sobreviver, voc√™ precisar√°:  \n- **Navegar com cuidado** pelas √°guas profundas, usando sua luz para localizar os krills.  \n- **Recarregar seu feixe luminoso** comendo algas brilhantes ‚Äì essencial para procurar os krills!  \n- **Se esconder** nos corais densos para despistar o predador.  \n\nCuidado: a Lula Gigante causa *dano*, e se voc√™ levar **3 ataques**, ser√° game over ‚Äì e volta para o in√≠cio da fase!  \n\n### *Detalhes extras:*  \n- *5 fases*, cada uma inspirada em *fossas oce√¢nicas reais*.  \n- *Progress√£o desafiadora*: s√≥ avan√ßa quem coletar *todos os krills*!  \n\n\nEnfrente sua *talassofobia* e mergulhe nessa aventura abissal! Ser√° que voc√™ consegue sobreviver √†s *profundezas* e escapar da Lula Gigante?  \n\nPara jogar:\n\n**Baixe o arquivo dispon√≠vel abaixo, extraia os arquivos e clique no arquivo execut√°vel.**\n\n\n### **Controles:**  \n\n- **Mover pra cima:** W  \n- **Mover pra baixo:** S  \n- **Mover pra direita:** D  \n- **Mover pra esquerda:** A  \n- **Faixo de Luz:** Barra de Espa√ßo (aumenta seu campo de vis√£o)  \n\nNos vemos no fundo do mar! üåäüêüüî•  \n \nEsperamos que gostem do conceito! Qualquer feedback √© bem-vindo. üòä\n\n---------------\n\n**The Abyssal Trenches: A Dive into the Depths of Ludum Dare 57!**  \n\n*Hey everyone! How‚Äôs it going?*  \n\nToday, we‚Äôre participating in *Ludum Dare 57*, whose theme is *\"Depths.\"* Inspired by this prompt, we decided to create our game: **The Abyssal Trenches**!  \n\n### *About the Game:*  \nIn the game, you take on the role of a **anglerfish**, a cute (or maybe not so cute) inhabitant of the ocean‚Äôs depths. Your goal is simple yet challenging: **eat all the krill** in each level to advance.  \nBut not everything is peaceful in the dark, icy waters of the abyss... The fearsome *Giant Squid* lurks in the shadows, ready to hunt you down! To survive, you‚Äôll need to:  \n- **Navigate carefully** through the deep waters, using your light to locate the krill.  \n- **Recharge your light beam** by eating glowing algae‚Äîessential for finding krill!  \n- **Hide** in dense coral to evade the predator.  \n\nBeware: the Giant Squid deals *damage*, and if you take *3 hits*, it‚Äôs game over‚Äîand you‚Äôll have to restart the level!  \n\n### *Extra Details:*  \n- *5 levels*, each inspired by *real oceanic trenches*.  \n- *Challenging progression*: you only advance if you collect *all the krill*!  \n\nFace your *thalassophobia* and dive into this abyssal adventure! Can you survive the *depths* and escape the Giant Squid?  \n\n\n### **Controls:**  \n\n- **Move Up:** W  \n- **Move Down:** S  \n- **Move Right:** D  \n- **Move Left:** A  \n- **Light Beam:** Spacebar (increases your field of vision)  \n\n\nSee you at the bottom of the sea! üåäüêüüî•  \n  \nWe hope you like the concept! Any feedback is welcome. üòä!",

I would like to send a big hug to them and to my students at FATEC University.\n\nThe first screen is just to test the commands that are being shown at the bottom.

Each ping briefly reveals nearby threats ‚Äî then you‚Äôre blind again. Navigate, dodge, and fire torpedoes using a mouse-only cockpit interface designed to challenge your perception, memory, and nerves.\n\n## üéÆ How to Play\nUse your mouse to interact with the cockpit controls:\n\n- Turn Left / Right\n- Change Speed\n- Fire Torpedo\n\nThe sonar pulses every few seconds, revealing enemy positions. Time your movement and aim carefully.\n\nDestroy 20 enemies to win ‚Äî if you survive that long.\n\n## üåä Theme & Design\nWe wanted to take the \"Depths\" theme literally and emotionally: setting the game in a deep-sea environment and creating an atmosphere of tension and isolation. Most games treat sonar as a secondary mechanic ‚Äî here, it‚Äôs your only source of vision. That moment of clarity during a ping, followed by the uncertainty of darkness, is where the tension lives.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Made With\n- Unity\n- 2 devs\n- 1 long weekend of coffee and chaos\n\n## üß† Looking for Feedback!\nWe‚Äôd love to hear what you think about the overall game design ‚Äî how it plays, how it feels, and whether it captures the tension we were going for.\n\n## Leaderboard:\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n(Be the first to comment your \"Win Screen\")\n\nAssets Used:\n- SFX: ZapSplat",

      "body": "**Sea Devil**\n\nInspired by the mysterious sea devil discovered off the coast of Tenerife in February 2025, this game delves into the unique journey we all undertake in life.\n\nThough the story may carry different meanings for each of us, it revolves around one universal theme: we all face countless challenges. Some will try to hinder our progress, while others will wish us well. Ultimately, it is only when we reach our destination that we can truly determine if the journey was worth it.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: This game is a work in progress. We acknowledge that it's not yet polished. One of the key elements still missing is the variety of sea creatures our protagonist encounters. For now, these creatures have been symbolically replaced with light.\n\nAssets:\n- Font: Playwrite Deutschland Grundschrift\n- Music: Blue Dot Sessions: Earth Mover - Saving the floe\n- Audio: freesound.org\n\nCredits:\n- programmer: Tom\n- 2D Artists: Wiwi, Searchu\n- Story, Project Management: Mirson",

Use WASD or arrow keys to move. Very short, playable in less than 5 minutes. \n\n----\n\nOn Saturday morning I was having a series of negative thoughts about my hobbies. They were thoughts like, \"I wish I was better at this hobby\", \"But I don't want to work on it right now\", and \"How can I wish I was better but also not take action to work on it?\" Thoughts like, \"I wish I loved this hobby more,\" or \"Is it a waste of time to do it if I don't love it all the time?\" \n\nSometimes the best way to counteract unhelpful thoughts is to move around and do something. I ended up joining Ludum Dare 57 to get some of the feelings off my chest. The theme coincided with this.\n\nThis isn't much of a game, but I feel better for having made it. \n\n\n--- \n\nAudio credits:\n- underwater sounds - https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/\n- guitar - https://freesound.org/people/Pensasneuvostoliittolainen/\n- guitar - https://freesound.org/people/eldricke22/",

This is a turn-based game where yours id the first and both your submarine and the enemy submarine only has 3 health points. In order to shoot a torpedo, you have to press the left mouse button\n\nand the torpedo will be launched in the path of the guide line(You can also disable the guide line if you want much more of a challenge).The enemy submarine will change its position if you your torpedo hits the enemy submarine.Also, you have can only move up(w) or down(s) in your turn, which can be identified in the top left corner of screen.",

Back in college, you two were roommates, the two of you dreamed about creating such a vessel. After graduation, the two of you worked together for years in order to make those dreams into reality. However, their impulsive nature led them to take the first working prototype on a joyride. That was a year ago. Building another one by yourself was a monumental endeavor, fueled by rage and betrayal. You have your own EvoAdaptive SymbioSub now. It is time to discover the fate of your partner and your shared dream.\n\nArt by @Xeridian, music by @lgpo, design and writing by @Theyflower, programming by @thristhart, @Zyrconium and @gqycloud",

Each throw shapes a soul's path, guiding them toward a fitting profession. The thread is theirs, but the pattern is yours to weave.\n\n**How to play**\n- Roll the dice each turn ‚Äî each face represents a skill.\n- Every roll moves you forward on the Wheel of Time.\n- The Wheel has 12 sections. When you reach the 12th, the soul‚Äôs life ends, and their final dice faces determine their profession. If it matches a known profession, you unlock it.\n- Events trigger when you land on a new section of the Wheel.\n- You can freeze a die to keep its face, but doing so makes your next roll move you an extra step forward on the Wheel.\n\nCr√©dits\n- Art: Vlad\n- Music and Art: Cl√©ment\n- Design and Prog: Qui\n\n",

If you sit and do nothing, you won't take damage (but you also won't progress). You can watch the pattern loop a few times before attempting it\n- The halo spinning around the resident's head can be used as a metronome\n- If you struggle a lot with a pattern, try getting the hang of one hand first and then introduce the other\n- You won't have to restart the level if you lose all your fingers\n- If you're using wireless headphones and the timing seems off, try switching to speakers or a wired connection. I noticed that on some wireless devices the latency is high enough to throw off the rhythm\n\nPlaythrough:\nhttps://youtu.be/pvA9mcjW1NI\n\nBugfixes:\n- 4/7/25 8:54 PM: Fixed bug involving tempo halo not reacting properly to beat changes in second half of level\n\nUse Mac and Linux builds at your own risk; I don't have the hardware to test them.\n",

Its luminous photophore fishing lure attracts other fish and is just waiting to snap at the right moment.\n\nIncrease the luminosity of your lure or let it fade away. Too much light will spook the prey fish and they will swim away. \nCatch as many fish as you can until the time is up!\n\n# How to play\n- **SPACE** to increase the light\n- **ENTER** to snap after fish\n\n\n- Round fish are faster and easier to scare, they score 200 points.\n- Long fish are slower and score 100 points.\n\n\n- Prey fish will first be interested in your lure (**?**)\n- ... then become suspicious (**!**)\n- ... and then flee (**!!!**)\n\n![AttractAndScare.png](///raw/78c/31/z/6a1b3.png)\n\n# Behind the scenes\nWe are a couple from Germany (Team Garnelio) who like to develop computer games at the weekend when the kids are at grandma's house. This is our third Ludum Dare contribution and we spend approx. 2 x 6 hours.\n\nIt's a very simple gameplay, the (stationary!) anglerfish can snap and glow. The look and feel of the game is hand-drawn and sketchy, we wanted to achieve a loose and watercolor-like effect. \nOur test sound made it into the final game - so don't expect any fancy background music, just ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWargh!‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlubb blubb blubb‚Äù.\n\n\n**marcari**: Main programming (Game Maker)\n\n**FrauKauz**: Some programming, artwork (Affinity Designer), sound effects\n\n",

      "body": "# Welcome to Dive into the Hive Mind!\n\n![cover.png](///raw/cca/84/z/6acf3.png)\n\nThey came from space, and they brought the buzzness.\n\nA swarm of alien bees has descended on Earth, short-circuiting cities, clogging satellites with wax, and causing mass pani-combs. But now, the source has been uncovered‚Äîan enormous, writhing brain drifting in low orbit, pulsing with psychic energy and radiating pure bee-vil.\n\nIts name? The Hivemind.\n\nPart neural network, part insectoid nest, all bad news. Every drone, every sting, every hex-tile of chaos‚Äîit all leads back to that big floating brain. And now, you‚Äôre going up there to end this buzzness once and for all.\n\nArmed with industrial-grade bug spray, a reinforced beekeeper suit, and the sheer will to bee victorious, you‚Äôve launched into orbit to face the swarm head-on. Dodge twitching tendrils, torch hive-laced lobes, and un-bee-lievably aggressive aliens as you push deeper into the squishy stronghold.\n\nYour target? The legendary Boss Bee‚Äîqueen of the swarm, mistress of mind control, and crowned neuro-nuisance of the galaxy.\n\nThink fast. Spray faster.\nIt‚Äôs time to sting before you get stung.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just pest control‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs space-brain bee-siege.\n\nAnd the fate of Earth?\nThat‚Äôs on your shoulders, honey.\n\n## About the game\n\nAt the heart of this game is a procedural generation algorithm that will generates the levels. No two play throughs will be the same!\n\nWe also have 2 different game modes. The story mode which you can access via the Start button and the Endless mode which you can access via the Endless button. The story mode game ends once you complete level 4, Endless mode is... well... Endless you keep on going as levels get harder and harder until finally you lose your final heart of health.\n\nHow deep into the depths can you go?\n\nWhile we do have a web build available, we recommend for best experience to download the version for your OS.\n\n## Controls\n\n### Keyboard and Mouse\n\n* WSAD for movement\n* Mouse to aim\n* Left mouse button to shoot the spray\n* Right mouse button/ F Key to punch\n\n### Controller Support!\n\nYes, we have controller support!\nTested on Windows 11 with both a PS4 controller and a wired Xbox controller.\n\nHeads up: If your operating system detects another device (like a joystick, steering wheel, or even certain USB devices) as a controller before your actual gamepad, it can cause some in-game controls to stop working properly.\n\nThe fix:\nUnplug any other device your OS might be misidentifying as a controller, then plug in your game controller. This should restore full functionality.\n\n* Left stick - Character movement\n* Right stick - Aiming\n* RT/RB - Shoot\n* LT/LB - Punch\n\n![game.png](///raw/cca/84/z/6acfb.png)\n\n## Words from the Dev Team\n\n### Bizzybee - Art, Music and SFX\n\nThe past few days have been one long manic episode for me, doodling like a madwoman and slapping down musical lines without (mostly) bothering to worry about their simplicity. I think my art even got a little better by the end of the jam. I'm more proud of this LD game than every other one we've done- though admittedly, that could be recency bias. I believe this is the most art I've made for one LD game.\n\nHonestly, I think finishing this LD has been a much needed mental boost for me- it's an accomplishment that couldn't have come at a better time, after a recent chronic fatigue diagnosis. As I said in our \"We're in!\" post, constraint is such a wonderful tool to help creativity flourish. It's so special to be able to make something in such a short time, with the help of talented and hardworking friends.\n\n\n### Fgeva - Programmer\n\nThis time we tried to do more up-front design, and it worked. No last minute panic because we didn't know what the game mechanics were! Pure bliss! (Also I might be Halucinating, I lack sleep)\nSeriously though, this went well. We had goals and stretch goals, and I think we actually hit all the goals, and maybe even some of the stretch goals!\n\n\n### Balimaar - Programmer\n\nThis jam went way smoother than LD56. Back then, we made Paper Cat Farms, which‚Äîdon‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîwas probably our best team effort at the time. But we basically went in with the plan: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a farming game!‚Äù ‚Ä¶and that was it. Zero roadmap, full chaos. The final push to the deadline? Manic. Utterly bee-serk.\n\nThis time? We actually used our brains before using our keyboards. We took a solid 30‚Äì60 minutes up front to figure out what we really wanted, what would be cool, and what would be straight-up dream material. And you know what? We hit all the must-haves, knocked out a bunch of the cool stuff, and even managed to sneak into dream territory here and there. Not too shabby.\n\nAs the programmer on the first shift (thanks to time zones, I could code for 12 hours and then hand off to Fgeva for the next 12‚Äîsmooth baton pass!), I was very nervous about implementing procedural generation. I had a rough understanding, but you know how these things go. The moment it actually worked? Oh. My. God. That wave of relief was divine. I ran into a few bugs by Day 2 or 3, but I even managed to fix most of them without introducing more. Miracles happen, apparently!\n\nHonestly, this was hands-down the best Ludum Dare I‚Äôve had. All it took was that little chunk of planning at the start to keep us from descending into last-minute panic mode. We spent less time screaming at our screens and more time actually enjoying the process.\n\n10/10. Would jam again.\n\n## A Peek Behind the Curtain\n### Biz Tells Us About Her Creative Process\n\nMusic: I decide to go for something electric sounding for the image of firing neurons and electrical synapses and whatnot. I started by searching \"electric\" in my instrument library and chose around 8 from the ones I found based off of pure vibes, noodling around and listening to a few seconds of each. I chose 3/4 for the bouncy bee rhythm, though you might not be able to tell with the syncopation. I decided my scale would center around the note B, of course. Then, I just messed around on my digital keyboard until I found a few notes in a sequence that sounded good. After that, I noodled around on my other instruments to see what I could add on top, and used the tried-and-true add an instrument or two every few bars.\n\nSFX: I used the instruments I had chosen for the game and searched for appropriate noise within them. I focused on the shortest sounds, though for the firing noise I shortened an 8-bit high-hat from my drumkit instrument. Downward or dissonant sounds for negative things, something airy and crunchy for shooting like a spray, satisfying crunch for picking up ammo, happy trill for health, and such.\n\nArt: I googled reference images of other games and of course, brains to get an idea of what I needed to do for the map. I used basic shapes to build the hero and bees to keep things easy on myself. I utilized mesh transform like all hell for many of the animations, that was really the MVP of my process to limit redrawing. Beyond that I made sure to keep the hero body parts on separate layers for easy rearranging and movement. I tried to keep the line thickness consistent where it made sense- making one mistake on the line thickness of the baby bees. I reused as much as possible in every way I could. Oh, when deciding the hero color, I went for the opposite on the color wheel from the dark purple ground- which ended up being green, to make sure the hero stood out. A lot of stuff I just glanced and winged it, though the main menu splash art I spent a bit more time with the brain lines and hand, closely following realistic googled references!",

Pilot your fragile vessel deeper and deeper into the crushing darkness, guided only by echoes of something immense, something ancient. The pressure mounts, resources dwindle, and the shadows writhe with unseen terrors.\n\nYou are hunted. A relentless presence descends from above, a colossal shadow chasing you down into the unknown. Push deeper, faster, using your wits and limited boost to stay ahead. Every meter gained is a desperate victory against the crushing weight of the ocean and the inevitable pursuit.\n\nWhat secrets lie hidden in the crushing black? What price must be paid to escape the abyss? Face the vast, somber terror that hunts you and discover the chilling truth lurking in the heart of the ocean.\n\n---\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot-menu-small.png](///raw/94d/71/z/6ab79.png)\n![screenshot-gameplay-small.png](///raw/94d/71/z/6ab7d.png)\n![screenshot-leaderboard-small.png](///raw/94d/71/z/6ab81.png)\n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\n*   **Move Mouse Left/Right:** Steer your vessel through the depths.\n*   **Click Mouse:** Activate a short boost to gain speed. Use it wisely to escape danger and navigate tight passages.\n\n---\n\n## Goal\n\n*   Descend as deep as possible, constantly outrunning the pursuing Leviathan chasing you from above. Manage your boost and navigate hazards to survive the descent.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n*   This game was created for [Ludum Dare 57](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/57/). Theme: **DEPTHS**.\n*   Atmosphere and the feeling of pressure are key components of the experience. Good luck!\n\n---\n\n## Development Notes\n\n*   **Time Spent:** Roughly 45 hours over the jam weekend.\n*   **Tech:** Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Kept it simple to focus on the core mechanic and atmosphere within the time limit. No engines or complex libraries.\n*   **Thoughts:** The core idea was to invert the usual 'climbing' escape and make it about descending away from a threat above. Getting the feel of the controls and the pressure of the chase was the main focus. Balancing the boost and the Leviathan's speed took a bit of iteration. Hope you enjoy the dive!\n\n---\n\n## Feedback Welcome!\n\nSeriously, **all feedback is incredibly welcome and appreciated!** Whether you loved it, hated it, found a weird bug, or have ideas for how it could be better ‚Äì I want to hear it all. Game jams are about learning and growing, and your thoughts are super valuable for that. Don't hold back!\n\n---\n\n## Let's Connect & Play!\n\n**Leave a comment below!** I'd love to know:\n\n*   What was your deepest point?\n*   Did the controls feel right?\n*   Any glitches or weirdness happen?\n*   What's one thing you'd add or change?\n\n**Also, drop a link to your game! I promise to play and rate every single game left in the comments here.** Let's check out each other's creations!",

Who knows what you will find down there, or what will find you. Be ready to dive into the darkness.\n\n## How to play\n- Explore the mine, but be aware that you only have a limited amount of oxygen. \n- Your suit can also be damaged, causing you to lose oxygen faster than usual. \n- Look for strange crystals growing from the walls as they may lead you to oxygen caches.\n- You are equipped with a harpoon, who knows when you will need it.\n\n## **Caution**\n- Please **do not resize the window** in this version, we will fix the UI after the jam. We just didn't solve it in time.\n\n## Errata\n- Controls: hold left-mouse-button for precision aim\n\n## Credits\n### Art\nZiry, Leumas, Franko\n### Programming\nLeumas, Franko, Ziry\n### Game Design\nFranko, Ziry, Leumas\n### Story\nZiry, Leumas, Franko\n### Sounds Effects\nZapsplat\nhttps://www.zapsplat.com/\n### Music\nDark Fantasy Studio\nhttps://darkfantasystudio.com/\n### Software Used\nhttps://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama\nPixelorama\nhttps://godotengine.org/\nGodot Engine\n### Special Thanks\nLeumas, Franko, Ziry and you - the player!\n\nThis was our first time trying to develop something with Godot, we hope you like it!\n\n\n#### Dev Food Stats ( or possible shopping list )\n- 10x pizza\n- No one knows how many coffees\n- Tons of candy\n- 500g pork greaves and lard\n- 2x bread\n- 3x onion\n- jar of pickles\n- jar of cranberry pate\n- jar of baby food (fruit)\n- 2x energy drink\n- 1x beer\n- 2x pack of smelly cheese (shoutouts to Olomouc!)\n- 2x pack of sponge cakes\n- 5x sour cream\n- spoon of cocoa\n- 1x Yorkshire Tea\n- 2 litres of milk\n",

Basic maneuvering and UI is implemented and the turrets look at enemies... actual gameplay yet to come! \n\nWIP Day 2: Some actual gameplay! We can move, the ai can move and we can shoot (but we don't do any damage yet), We now have some music in the main menu and the core game scene. Also created some laser sfx! Oh, and the squadrons have a boid like movement where they follow their home ship around - they don't do anything yet but they are going to eventually be able to do bombing runs on their home ships target.\n![scren.png](///raw/b25/46/z/69898.png)\n\n\nWIP Day 3: A true gameplay loop has been established, with lots of bug fixes and quality of life enhancements. Ships now explode! lots of particles added. ![screen25.png](///raw/b25/46/z/6a031.png)![scree24.png](///raw/b25/46/z/6a032.png)",

Wanted to do some dream thing but that we needed something a bit more concrete vs. lots of mini-games.  Some of the original idea came from some sort of lemmings game...  We wanted to have the robot help and bring additional equipment to assist the rescue.. we also wanted to make it more dangerous for the creatures to survive, risk of lava, etc...\n\nThanks for playing.\n",

      "body": "**Warning : The web version has long loading times (30 second-ish the first time you start a new game). Also, the pixel art graphics might look worse because of stretching. For optimal experience, use the executable.**\n\n## --- DESCRIPTION ---\n**Kind of deep waters** is a deep sea exploration game with procedurally generated levels. Carefully maneuver your bathyscaphe (i.e. a fancy word for submarine) to descend into trenches while avoiding dangerous creatures and obstacles. As you go deeper, the environment will become darker and will force you to use your light projector to progress safely. Collect treasures to buy upgrades and explore even deeper! What secrets will you unveil in the **depths**?\n\n## --- INSTRUCTIONS ---\n* Your goal is to reach the bottom of the level.\n* If your air depletes completely, you lose.\n* Violently colliding with obstacles or getting hit by enemies will damage your hull. Hull damage translates to increased periodic air loss.\n* Collect air bubbles to restore air.\n* Collect pearls for money that you can use to upgrade your bathyscaphe.\n\n## --- CONTROLS ---\n### Mouse & keyboard\n* **WASD** or **ARROW KEYS**: move the bathyscaphe\n* **MOUSE** : move the light projector\n\n### Joypad\n* **CROSS** or **LEFT PAD**: move the bathyscaphe\n* (sadly, we didn't have time to implement light projector movement and UI navigation with joypad)\n\n## --- NOTES ---\n* Yes, the game is *kind of hard*. That's why we decided to allow access to the shop (and not losing progress) even if you lose.\n* There is no pause feature.\n* You can only access the settings from the main menu.\n* All progress is lost if you leave the game.\n\n## --- CREDITS ---\n### The team\nWe're a team of 4 friends irl. Most of us are experienced in programming and even in game dev, but we're teaming up on a project for the very first time!\n* **510**\n* **7uc4s**\n* **fullbuff**\n* **maximence**\n\nSpecial thanks to our other friend **ploufboum** who joined us during the jam and helped us by improvising some music.\n\n### Tools\n* **Godot Engine** (game engine)\n* **Aseprite** (pixel art graphics)\n* **BeepBox** (music)\n* **Audacity** (music and SFX post-processing)\n* **Bfxr** (SFX generation)\n* **ChatGPT** (coding assistance and generation of the sprites we didn't have time to draw, notably the items you find at the end of levels)\n\n## --- SCREENSHOTS ---\n![image55.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a957.png)\n![image11.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a95b.png)![image6.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a95c.png)![2image.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a965.png)",

Ready to be evaluated?_\n\nIn \"__Deep Sleeve__\", you play as someone who has just been abducted by a pair of aliens and taken to __deep__ space.\nTheir objective? Evaluate your species' intelligence, through you.\nTheir method? A card game.\nThere's no way you can win. Not unless you cheat. Luckily, the aliens are easily distracted, and your sleeves are __deep__...\n\n![image.png](///raw/22e/06/z/6b188.png)\n\n## Rules\n\nThe goal of the game is to **survive a round**. A game lasts until someone loses all their \"**HP**\", which are the little tokens on the table before you. You begin with 15 tokens.\n\nRounds are a fight between two cards. Players play one after another, selecting a card amongst those in their hand. You win a round by playing a **lower** card than what your opponent plays.\n\nLosing a round makes you lose tokens equal to **the difference between the two cards** that were played (the one you played, and the one your opponent played.)\n\nThere are seven kinds of cards in the deck : -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n![cardsss.png](///raw/22e/06/z/6b1e8.png)\n\n1 through 5 are self-explanatory, but -2 (two diagonals) and the 0 (diamond) have **special rules**.\nPlaying a **0** allows you to \"lose\" a round but not take any damage (unless your opponent plays a -2).\nThe **-2 card** is the only card that can inflict damage through a 0 card, and will win against every card **except** the 5, which makes you lose 5 points.\n\n_\"Kiwi Soda\" font by jeti (fontenddev.com)_",

So, welcome to the **Department of Deep Digging**!\n\n---\n\n## How to Play\n\n- You control the worm by selecting it and dragging a path through the map.\n- The worm can only dig a limited number of tiles before he starves and dies.\n- To keep him going, guide him through special dirt tiles that regenerate his strength.\n- You can only continue digging from the red square ‚Äî not just anywhere on the map.\n- You improve your score if you pass more of the numbered tiles\n\n---\n\nThis was one of my first times developing a game and also my first time using **Godot**, so the game isn't fully complete. \n",

Upgrade your ship, collect more scrap and use it to craft what you need.\n\n## Objectives\nGather enough scrap to craft the long range communicator and call for help.\n\n## Controls\n- W/S - Accelerate forward/backward\n- A/D - Rotate left/right\n- Q/E - Accelerate left/right\n- Space - Dampen movement\n- Ctrl - Free rotation\n- 1 - Toggle collector\n- Left mouse button - Collect hovered scrap\n- Esc/P - Pause\n\n## Gameplay\nYou start at your space station, where you will be able to craft upgrades for your ship once you gather resources for it. \n\nClicking Launch will put you in your ship inside the asteroid field. Locate resources using the radar, approach them, turn on your collector and click resources in range to collect them.\n\nOnce you run out of fuel, you will be automatically returned to the station, where you will be able to craft upgrades and launch again.\n\n## Assets\nAll graphics and music were made during the jam.\n\nThe Gyrotrope font is used under SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1\n> Copyright 2025 David Moles (https://github.com/dmoles/gyrotrope-font), with Reserved Font Name Gyrotrope",

Tasked with providing critical support to Allied forces in Europe, your vessel must cross a vast, unforgiving ocean. Silent, and under constant threat. The cold steel around you groans under the pressure, and the only thing standing between survival and a watery grave is your crew‚Äôs grit and your command.\n\nAs enemy planes hunt overhead and the deep crushes in below, you must navigate a deadly balance of depth, speed, and silence. Every decision carries weight ‚Äî push too hard and systems will fail, rise too close and you risk detection. Manage your crew, repair what you can, and pray the hull holds. This is not just a mission... it‚Äôs a descent into the unknown.\n\n# üéì How To Play\n\n## üéØ The Objective\nYour mission is to safely guide your submarine across the Atlantic and reach Europe. To survive the journey, you‚Äôll need to manage your crew and systems while balancing depth and speed. Keep the sub running, avoid detection, and hold together long enough to complete your crossing.\n\n## üïπÔ∏è Basic Controls \n\n- **Left Mouse Button** To pick up and move crew members.\n- **Middle Mouse Button/WASD** to pan the camera.\n- **Scroll Wheel** to zoom the camera in and out.\n- **Up & Down Arrows** surface and dive the submarine.\n- **Left & Right Arrows** to increase and decrease your speed.\n\n<sup>Cover image generated with AI</sup>",

      "body": "# Welcome!\nThis is my take at the Theme. I wanted to introduce it more like lore and feel, not that much of a gameplay mechanic. For a lot of time i wanted to play around with the idea of a top-down survival (but with a twist), and i thought \"NOW is the chance!\". All feedback is welcome, and let me know if i should develop it into a full game. Thanks a lot for Playing!\\\n\n# [Story time]\n\nYou are the knight, who's fond of the king's daughter - the beautiful princess. You train hard every day, in hopes that she notices you. Every day is a struggle for her attention. There is an event soon, where you need to be the princess' personal guard. You think that is finally your chance! But later you learn that the event is actually the princess' wedding. You are heartbroken. And what is the best medicine for a broken heart? That's right! Alcohol. But you've had too much at the local pub and you seem to be lost on your way home into the Darkwood forest where flesh-eating slime reside. The only thing with you is your personal see-in-the-dark slime, who also happens to be your bestfriend and drinking buddy. Survive for as long as possible, and evade the deadly Mobs.\n \n# {Controls}\n\n\nWASD / Arrow Keys -> Movement\n\nSpace -> Roll\n\nESC -> Pause Game\n\n![main_menu_scrsh.png](///raw/f9a/e5/z/6979d.png)![game_scrsh.png](///raw/f9a/e5/z/6979e.png)",

The Alternate link below seems to work fine?\n\nYou know how some sci-fi universes have stations floating inside of gas giants, or dense atmospheres like Venus'? You control an airship bringing cargo between several of those.\n\n![Airship.png](///raw/c33/z/6a195.png)\n\nDifferent layers (depths) of the atmosphere have different air currents. If you use these properly, you can get to your destinations much faster, and if you don't account for the wind, you might not be able to get there at all.\n\nThis game isn't my best work, but hopefully the concept is at least briefly interesting. If you find the Normal mode boring, try Hot Air Balloon mode! It's weird and hard, but more unique and closer to my original idea (thought of when voting on themes - I repurposed my idea for \"Layers\").\n\n#### Controls:\n- **Left Click** to move towards the mouse\n- **Mouse wheel** to zoom\n- **Esc** to return to the main menu\n\n",

Every sound of collision could be the trigger to wake up your mother‚Äîcan you satisfy your hunger before she wakes up, or will you be caught red-handed?\n\n---\n\n## **Basic Controls:**\n\n- **Move the mouse** ‚Üí Aim at the food  \n- **Click Left Mouse Button** ‚Üí Grab the food  \n- **Hold Right Mouse Button** ‚Üí Move the camera horizontally\n- **Hold Spacebar** ‚Üí Pull the food out\n\n---\n\n> ![Screenshot 2025-04-08 005222.png](///raw/407/46/z/6a3b8.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Heartbeat Quick-time Event:**\n\n- When the screen shows a shrinking circle, press Spacebar at the right moment ‚Üí Steady your heartbeat!\n  \n---\n  \n> ![Screenshot 2025-04-08 011630.png](///raw/407/46/z/6a3a8.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Winning Conditions:**\n\n- Get everything shown in the menu.\n\n---\n\n> ![Screenshot 2025-04-08 012546.png](///raw/407/46/z/6a3bb.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Failure Conditions:**\n\n- When the alertness bar fills up or you failed to steady your heartbeat, your mother wakes up.\n\n> ![Screenshot 2025-04-08 012901.png](///raw/407/46/z/6a3c3.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Tips:**\n\n- When you pick up the food, it shakes, so remember to time it right and zoom in to guide it through the gaps between obstacles.\n\n---\n\n# **It‚Äôs all for the midnight snack!**\n\n---\n\n## **Developer Notes:**\nWe came up with this idea from our personal experiences of rummaging through the depths of our fridges for food, sometimes behind our parents' back. We wanted to create a sense of tension when playing, so we added the QTE where you almost get discovered by your parents. Hope you enjoy our game!\n",

Spanning over 300 square kilometers across the\nPacific's western frontier, this leviathan of steel and concrete once channeled the atom's\nfury into boundless energy for coastal nations. Now its molten core lies entombed in the\nMariana Trench's lightless depths, spewing radioactive venom that multiplies\nexponentially through ocean currents.\nHumanity and marine ecosystems face an existential crisis measured in hours. You've\nbeen drafted into the final desperate strike force - descending 30,000 feet in a jury-rigged\nsubmersible to retrieve every fissile fragment before Earth's hydrological cycle becomes\nirreversibly poisoned. This is a one-way plunge into the abyss. Our vessels lack energy for\nthat depth. Survival demands scavenging energy from the very reactor debris we find.\nImprovise. Adapt. Collect the core's malignant shards to fuel your crusade against\nannihilation. The fate of all lives hangs on your ability to outthink the crushing darkness.",

      "body": "# Explore the depths of sub-zero Europa.\n\n## With the discovery of what appears to be a liquid cave system in the frozen outer core, this mission to Jupiter's moon Europa hopes to learn what they can about the oceans within.\n\n## Controls\n- **Steer left and right with `A/D`,`J/L` or `Left/Right Arrows`**.\n- **Slow descent with `W`,`I` or `Up`**.\n- **Toggle waystation deploy mode with `Space`**. There's an audio cue for on/off.\n- **Then collide with a surface to deploy**. The waystation will attach and your submersible can keep going.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- **Your energy depletes constantly** in the cold. Info at the top left of the screen\n- You will **return to the launch point when it runs out**.\n- Max energy is 40, you start with max when you launch.\n- **Deploy a waystation to recharge energy**. You get +20 when you deploy.\n- **Touch a waystation on your next run to recharge**. You get +20 energy as well.\n- Each run you can **use a chain of waystations to descend deeper and deeper**.\n- **You need 50 materials to construct a replacement waystation** at the start of each descent.\n- Materials info on the top right of the screen.\n- Gathering a material resource gives you +10 materials.\n- Takes about 15-20 mins on average for a full playthrough to the best ending.\n- Use `M` to toggle the music.\n\n![cover_image.png](///raw/8c8/2/z/6a67a.png)\n\n## Tools\n- Godot 4.4\n- Aseprite\n- Garageband\n- Bfxr\n- VSCode & iTerm for minor coding bits\n- Figma & Trello for planning\n- Chasm Palette - from LoSpec created by dysphoriaa\n\n## Mini-mortem\nThis is the first game I've built in Godot, my goal for the jam was to learn how to build a game with Godot and to make  background music & sound effects (because I always drop them). Originally I was going to enter the Compo but I ofc bit off more than I could chew. I decided I'd like to add a little more than I could get done in the 48 hours, so it's a Jam entry but it's all built by myself, the game is much better for the extra time.\n\nI said to myself before the jam: \"No level design! It always takes too long!\" :laughing: \n\n## Hints and known issues\n- Don't restart if you're getting close to the end of the 5 days. Stick it out.\n- There's no in-game restart, you have to refresh the page. Soz.\n- The material resources are the little green diamonds scattered about.\n- You can attach the waystation to the walls at the side if you need to.",

      "body": "This is a game about rolling a fat reefer and taking a perfect hit from it :smirk: \n\n![rolling5.gif](///raw/da7/93/z/6b164.gif)\n\n**How to play**\n- Step 1: Left click to spread the weed on the joint. Use the weed spread meter to spread it evenly for a perfect experience.\n- Step 2: Move the mouse and use the scroll to roll the joint (scroll up and down, as if you're rolling it for real lol). In this step you can correct some mistakes you did in step 1.\n- Step 3: Hold left click to chief on your dooby. Take a proper long hit but dont hit it for too long or you might cough and everybody will think you're a rookie.\n\n![rolling3.gif](///raw/da7/93/z/6b168.gif)\n\n![rolling4.gif](///raw/da7/93/z/6b16a.gif)\n\nYou can press F or F4 to switch to fullscreen. And escape to quit.\n\n**How is this related to the theme ?**\n\nEh well it isn't really. Originally I wanted to add a cutscene at the end of the game where I would generate randomly some dumb sentences that we tend to say when we're high, and there would be a guy that would say \"Damn thats deep bro\". This cutscene is where this whole game idea came from. Sadly I didn't find the time to do it :pensive: \n\n**Known issue**\n\nFor some reason after a certain time the game can fuck with some windows interface. I hope its not because of my horrible code but it seems that I am not the only one having this issue: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/89712\n\nMusic made by my good friend Lord Grand Swag: https://soundcloud.com/lordgrandswag",

Drill phase\n\nUse your mouse to point the direction where you want the drill to dig.\n\nThe fuel that is consumed when the dirt is removed is limited. Plan accordingly!\n\nYou can end the drilling phase manually by clicking the button at the top right.\n\n# 2. Coffin'Time\n\nUse the mouse to drag and drop the coffins to bury them. Be careful, you need to finish your job before the end of the night!\n\nYou can end the burying phase manually by clicking the button at the top right.\n\nTip: You can stack the members of the same family together, in order to save some space. \n\n# 3. Funeral \n\nThe townfolks come early in the morning to mourn their losses. Let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt stumble across some coffins layin in the morning sun‚Ä¶\n\n \n\n*Credits :*\n\n*Nicolas Lanore*\n\n*Linda Hammoud*\n\n*Alexis Louis*\n\n*Th√©o Walcker*\n\n*Boris Escande*\n\n![screnshot.JPG](///raw/ee6/c5/z/69a3e.jpg)\n\nThis game was made in godot 4.4 in 48h for the Ludum Game Jam 57.

      "body": "SUMMARY\n-------\n\nThis is a simple Tower Escape game where you must avoid traps and find the trigger to open the gate on each floor.\n\nThere are 100 floors to escape from and each floor gets harder than the last. There is only ever ONE trigger to open the gate on the floor, there will ALWAYS be multiple traps to slow you down or hurt you.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nThanks for playing my game!\n\nTRAILER\n-------\n\nMy youngest sone created a trailer for the game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/x4eToNxAvJc?si=a0KK8aYnA8FFLuPX\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n------------\n- MOVE LEFT = A or LEFT ARROW\n- MOVE RIGHT = D or RIGHT ARROW\n- INTERACT = E or DOWN ARROW\n- JUMP = SPACE or UP ARROW\n- RUN = HOLD SHIFT\n\nX/Grok Factor\n-------------\n\nFor this game I did a bit of an experiment. To come up with the idea for the game, I used GROK on X to work through the game elements and even had it generate some pseudo code, which I used for initial prototyping. I then continued to work on the game without the help of GROK to completion.\n\nIt was an interesting experiment, and I found that it was actually able to come up with several good ideas, but I needed to guide it in order to zero in on what I wanted to make.\n\nPICTURES\n--------\n![2025-04-07_08-43-48.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a230.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-44-40.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22d.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-46-19.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22e.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-47-02.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22f.png)",

A [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) cartridge with a Minesweeper inspired game.\n\n![p8sweeper_3.png](///raw/24e/e3/z/6a7a6.png)\n\n\n![p8sweeper_6.gif](///raw/24e/e3/z/6a831.gif)\n\n\n# Manual\n\n* A number on the grid means how many mines are around that field. Diagonal mines count as half.\n\n* Notation: a `:` symbol is used in the game to mean \"and a half\" (+0.5)\n\n| In game | Value |\n| -------- | ------- |\n|  (no symbol) | 0 |\n| `:` | 0.50 |\n| `1` | 1 |\n| `1:` | 1.5 |\n| `2` | 2 |\n| `2:` | 2.5 |\n| `3` | 3 |\n| `3:` | 3.5 |\n| `4` | 4 |\n| `4:` | 4.5 |\n| `5` | 5 |\n\n* Solving examples:\n\nHere you can see that all of the marked fields must be empty because they touch fields with a \"zero\". The rightmost arrow is also empty because the `:` can only have diagonal mines close to it (otherwise it would be 1 or more).\n\n![431121381-c4785333-4306-4c67-bda5-310de50f2751.png](///raw/24e/e3/z/6a7b5.png)\n\nNow in the next step you can see that the only field left for the `:` must be a mine.\n\n![431121762-e7109731-17fb-46f9-a317-fc0c4ee6d645.png](///raw/24e/e3/z/6a7b6.png)\n\nHere you see that the corner `1` already has a diagonal mine, so it can't have any horizontally or vertically adjacent mines, otherwise it would be 1.5. The arrow to the right is showing how the only way to solve the `1:` is to place a mine there.\n\n![431122432-e183e93a-3c55-4bad-82b8-ed24642b560e.png](///raw/24e/e3/z/6a7b7.png)\n\n# Dev notes\n\n* Unfortunately the board generation sometimes forces you to guess. But that makes the game more high stakes ;) But you can very often deduct things indirectly, so try to use logic!\n* I made this in 48h with the Compo rules, but I started on Sunday, so couldn't submit for the Compo on time.\n* It was nice to try out a new platform, I recommend giving PICO-8 a try!\n* Thank you for playing! Happy to hear your feedback.",

Exploring the depths requires caution‚Äîno one knows what the gnomes might dig up next üêâ\n\n### Story\nDeep within the bowels of ancient mountains, two daring gnomes, Borin Stonebiter ‚Äãand Thrommir Ironbeard‚Äã, labor to create a tunnel that will lead them to treasures hidden for millennia. Despite the elders' warnings, these enterprising treasure seekers decided to begin mining the oldest land. Around them is only the echoing sound of picks and the dim light of torches illuminating the gloomy vaults of the mine. The rock here is hard as if the earth itself resists their efforts, but the gnomes do not despair: after all, in the depths awaits a cache of rubies shining brighter than stars. üåü\n\nBorin, an experienced miner with muscular arms and a cunning gaze, keeps count of his pickaxe strikes, each time digging deeper into the stone mass. His partner, Thrommir, a calculating and cautious master blacksmith, occasionally checks the sharpness of the tools' blades to make the work go faster and more efficiently. Together they form the perfect team: one digs, the other supports, both dream of wealth waiting at the end of the path. üí∞\n\nEach blow of the pick brings them closer to their goal. Each ruby found fills their hearts with joy and hope. And although there is still much work ahead, Borin and Thrommir are confident: someday they will reach their coveted prize and become legends among all gnomes, but at what cost? üíÄ\n\n### Contacts\nhttps://x.com/epiclogogames\n\nhttps://t.me/epiclogogames\n\nhttps://vk.com/epiclogogames\n\nart https://vk.com/shkaflavasha\n\n\n### Tutorial\nWe understand that a wall of text is a bad tutorial, but we didn't want to give up game features in favor of learning (even though we had to due to limited time), so we'll have to read.\n\n![mouse.png](///raw/f76/36/z/6a34b.png)\nuse left mouse button for place tile on map, and use right mouse button for rotate tile to right side\n\n![tunnel.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a5b.png)\nto build tunnels, you need to connect tiles so that the tunnels on them match\n\n![mush_pla—Åe.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a5a.png)\nto build mushroom caves, you need to connect tiles so that the caves on them match\n\n![mush_not_closed.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a59.png)\nuntil all the borders of the existing mushroom farm tiles are closed, you will not receive bonuses for building a cave.\n\n![mush_closed.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a53.png)\nto get new tiles for completing the mushroom cave, you need to close all the borders of the tiles already exposed on the field with mushrooms.\n\n![mush_closed_on_border.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a54.png)\nthe border can be combined with any title, and the side of the mushroom farm in contact with the border is considered closed.\n\n![ruby.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a81.png)\nA ruby is just a small ruby that turns out to be right in the rock, no bonuses except for the pleasant feeling of the weight of the pocket.\n\n![hole1.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a82.png)\nRuby Hole is the main reward for any dwarf, the more rubies the more rubies!

But when he arrives, he discovers the horrifying truth: the retreat is a front for a sentient mushroom colony using keto compliance to brainwash recruits. Luckily, Rob‚Äôs lifelong diet of pizza and skepticism makes him immune to their carb-deficient mind control. Now, trapped in a deep cave, he must fistfight his way through an army of keto-zombies and fungal cultists.\n\n**Controls**\n\nJump: Spacebar\n\nMove: WASD\n\nLook: Mouse\n\nPunch: Left Click\n\n\n![Untitled-3.png](///raw/b00/e/z/6b10d.png) ![Screenshot 2025-04-07 214919.jpg](///raw/b00/e/z/6b12e.jpg) ![Screenshot 2025-04-07 214825.png](///raw/b00/e/z/6b120.png)",

In the distance, you can see deep into the valley, where your hometown lies waiting. But you're not the best hiker, and your posture is pretty wobbly so don't fall over!\n\nThe character moves automatically‚Äîit's up to you to tilt and balance in all directions to avoid falling over. The mountain is snowy, windy, bumpy, and full of tricky terrain that will test your reflexes and control. Can you keep your footing and make it all the way to the cozy town in the valley without falling?\n\n## What I wanted‚Ä¶ but didn‚Äôt quite finish (ah, Game Jam struggles!)\n\nI ended up making the level way too big and had to rush to fill it with some content. I had planned to add more obstacles to challenge your balance, but hopefully, it still gets the idea across!\n\nAnd I couldn‚Äôt really test it. So hey, bugs are free, I guess!\n\nSometimes the camera is in the ground, ups...\n\n## How to Play\n\n- Keep the balance: W/A/S/D\n- Run Faster: E\n- Run Slower: Q\n- Pause: Escape\n\nYou can see the hiker‚Äôs balance in the corner of the screen, or reflected in the character‚Äôs spine posture. The faster you go, the more force is applied to your balance.\n\n![3.PNG](///raw/3c5/e5/z/6a640.png)\n\n## Windows Getting Started\n\nSorry just Windows only this time...\n- Download zip from this page\n- Unzip the file downloaded\n- Start the WobbleDown.exe\n\n## Tools\n\n- Unity\n- Blender\n- Audacity",

Jump and dive with Space to leap dangerous gaps! Grab throw and put down specimen with E to bring them back to the minecart!\n\nFind and retrieve all 6ish samples:\n\n1. Amethyst Geode - Great to start.\n\n2. Gigantic Bone - Too wide for some gaps.\n\n3. Large Glow Worm - Wriggles too tall for some ledges.\n\n4. Blood Opal - Several tons in weight, you can't jump while holding it.\n\n5. Amber Drop - Sticky to the point you move at a snails pace, you can still jump though.\n\n6. The Deepest Diamond - Deep under the lava, you will have to collect this last.\n\n?. The Silliest Goose - ??????.\n\nBonus challenge: Speed run\nTry and beat the Dev's time : 3:23.693\nOr the fastest in the comments : Be the first!\nThis kinda goes on the honor system, also no geese allowed!\n\nDev note: This actually came out pretty good in my eyes. In previous years I've had to cut down a lot, which still happened, though to a very lesser degree. This was also my first fully 3d project. I ended up learning a lot about how unity works along the way. Anyways hope you enjoy!\n\nPS. Sometimes it seems you can get stuck on the walls, just try and jump above the block to fix it.\n\nPrograming & Art:\nThe Silliest Goose\n\nMusic: Night Cave - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",

The chosen one, cutter of grass, giver of grass.  \n\nYour trusty steed? A beetle. Not just any beetle, but a grass-cutting machine with an insatiable hunger for the greens. On aerial support you have your loyal Dragonfly, slaving away collecting that freshly cut grass. I am sure he's got the stamina for it.  \n\nYour mission: Navigate through lush, deep grasslands, slicing and dicing vegetation like its all you know.\nYou're not just cutting grass for the pleasure of cutting grass. Oh no. You're collecting these fresh trimmings to appease the most discerning clients in the botanical universe; rock golems. These rocky road blockers are very particular about their grass delivery service. Want to progress? Better have a bag of grass ready.  \n\nIt's part janky racing game, part lawn mower beetle simulator, and 100% pure homegrown grass. The game jam theme was \"depth,\" and boy, did we take that‚Ä¶somewhere‚Äîwe're talking DEEP grass.\n\n\nUse WASD to control!\n\nA / D - Turn beetle left / right\n\nS - Slow down the beetle (easier turning)\n\nW - Dash!!\n\n",

Hopefully you'll find the planet you are so desperatly seaching for!\n\n---\n\nIn this game, you use cards to combine with other cards to make more cards. Simple, right? You need to fly your spaceship to your target position. For this, you'll encounter different events, such as pirate attacks, ship wrecks and more.\n\nCan you figure out how to proceed and how to reach your goal without dying? Good luck!\n\n---\n\nInfo: We opted out of the graphics section, since *most* of the icons were from https://icones.js.org/. We did do a few icons ourself :)",

You need to figure out which station can produce which recipe.\n\nYou can use nearby tables as storage places if you run out of time for an order and don't want to destroy a particular piece of equipment.\n\nYou can also use a garbage bin to dispose of any item in case there's too much stuff lying around.\n\nThere are two stations:\n\n* Crafting bench\n* Anvil\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-07 202431.png](///raw/cfe/a5/z/6a3be.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-07 202544.png](///raw/cfe/a5/z/6a3bf.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-07 202626.png](///raw/cfe/a5/z/6a3c0.png)\n\n![1.png](///raw/8f2/9/z/6a5d6.png)\n\n![2.png](///raw/8f2/9/z/6a5de.png)",

Make sure to have at least one extra credit in your account after collection.\n- If you pick up more than 3 relics, the UI will still show 3/4 relics. You can still return to the ship once you are sure you collected 4 or more to get a win condition.\n- Straying too far from the ship may result in some unexpected outcomes\n\n\n## Enjoy!\n\n\n![Screenshot from 2025-04-08 02-48-01.png](///raw/5f0/24/z/6ae5c.png)\n![Screenshot from 2025-04-08 02-49-00.png](///raw/5f0/24/z/6ae5a.png)\n![Screenshot from 2025-04-08 03-45-42.png](///raw/5f0/24/z/6b108.png)\n\nCredits:\nSkybox texture from https://freestylized.com/",

Inspired by the eerie liminality of the backrooms, the building stretches into surreal, endless corridors filled with ghostly remnants of corporate burnout.\nArmed with only a flickering flashlight, you must venture deeper room by room, using light to capture restless spirits. Face your fears, and descend into the depths of your own exhaustion... if you dare clock out.\n\nMade in 3 Days for Ludum Dare 57.

Tree in space? Maybe it's the Universe or gour subcontious?\n\nYou will get 7 questions. Instead of giving concrete answers you answer with a colored cube. :spy: \n\n### The story\n\nBased on your answers.. the Tree will analyze you and will spit out what it thinks. ; )\n\n### Different questions\n\nYou will get a randomized set of questions with every run.\n\n### Different answers / different story\n\nAfter you've gotten the story you will see an *~ Ask me again ~* button. Clicking this resets the game and you will get a set of new questions.\n\nMaybe you could answer differently next time? :wink: \n \n\n## Out of scope\n\nSo many things left undone (begging for a post-compo): \n- effects, actually showing off more beautiful trees / see this post: \n- more questions to come, greater variety of questions, hense more diverse end story\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n**No AI tools have been used or even tried during the development of this game.**\n\n## Dev/programmer stuff\n\nTotal coding time is < 10 hours.

A very simple game where the primary focus for me was to learn some art finally! The biggest win for me was that all art was made by me from scratch inside 48 hours. I had a lot of fun.\n\nTRUE STORY: I have never done pixel (or any art) for games before, and I only downloaded Libresprite 15 minutes before the jam started. I was very happy with my progress from 0 to .. well not 0 lol baby steps! \n\n\n#### FULLSCREEN GAMEPLAY AVAILABLE VIA ITCH.IO LINK BELOW ###\n",

After each wave of enemies, players choose from a set of upgrades to shape their build before diving deeper.

Smash your way downward through the layers of ground using your high-powered drill. Just like in breakout, getting in amongst the tiles will cause some point scoring chaos. Descend into the depths collecting gems and rare minerals which will give you a large points boost. Watch out for the lava and get as deep as you can in 3 mins.\n",

Click on any one of them to initiate a conversation.\n\nWhen you do, you'll see a panel on the right-hand side of your screen showing your progress extracting information from them. Click any button with a dialogue bubble to start talking.\n\nDuring conversations, you'll see a little pin next to the suspect's dialogue box, if you think that line might be important, **put a pin on it** by clicking the Pin icon. This will put that line in your Inventory and from there you can read it, or use it during any other conversation to help you uncover the truth.\n\nIf you can no longer get any information, you'll be **BRICK WALLED**, and the buttons will reflect that, move on to someone else, or see if you missed anything!\n\n## Credits\n\nFupicat: Graphics, music, sound design, story wrangling, dialogue writing.\n\nKett: Programming, dialogue writing.\n\n[Full list of credits and assets here!](https://github.com/KettLovahr/murder-for-dessert?tab=readme-ov-file#credits)",
