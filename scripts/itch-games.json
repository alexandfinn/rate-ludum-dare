You have a magic spell to return to the surface, but it cannot bring back any of the ore you mine. To do this, you will need to charge up a ore portal spell. This will receive a charge for every 10 levels you go down.\n\nDon't run out of durability on your pickaxe, or you will be automatically returned to the surface, and lose any ore you didn't send back.\n\n## Progression\n​Progress is saved whenever you visit the shop or the mine.\n\n## Controls\nMovement - WASD\nJump - Space\nMine\n - Up - E\n - Left/Right - F ​depends on which way you're facing\n - D​own - C\n\n## Shop\nIn your blacksmith shop, you can smelt and sell ores. Click Smelt and select the ore you'd like to turn into a bar. Rare ore require 2, while common require 5, to smelt.\n\nOnce done, click on the cave entrance button, to head into the mine\n\n## ​​Mine\n​In the mine navigate around and break the rocks. You have a limited durability, so keep an eye on it. After you've went down at least 10 levels, the ore portal spell charge will increase. Click the button to send ores you've collected back to the shop.

Initially I had different ideas, I wanted to make an adventure game using some mechanics derived from different meanings of depth, but ended up with something quite different (though the main mechanic is more or less the same).\n\nOverall I'm satisfied as this time I submitted a \"full\" game, with menus, audio and a whole level. Good enough for the first Ludum Dare. Let's see if I can make it better the next time.\n\n--------------------\n*I say it in plural but there is only one level.

If the strength of a column or row ever drops too low, the entire mine collapses and it is game over.\n\nGreen gems are the scoring currency. Pink bolts give energy, which is constantly decreasing while moving and even more so when excavating. Orange framing materials let  you automatically shore up an area that would otherwise cause a collapse.",

Once it's ready, dash forward and smash through whatever's in your way.\n\nAcross three increasingly weird stages, you’ll face physics-based challenges that require creativity and stubbornness.

With each passing night, its jealousy grew and grew, until one night, the moon descended to the earth to weep. Its jealous tears flooded the world, washing all color from the land. Before long, the entire earth was dull.\n\nA brave earth spirit heard the cries of anguish and ventured out toward the sound. As it touched the moon's tears, it realized how to restore the depths of color to the world...\n\n![ShootIcon.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6b0a4.png)\n\n**All art, music, sound effects, and writing created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 57: Depths.**\n\nStay tuned for our post-jam version, which will include composer notes explaining how we interwove **17**(!) different tracks to represent the blooming and deepening of complexity and color as the game progresses. Yes, the jukebox is for those of you who would rather make music by turning knobs than catching tears.\n\n*We hope you enjoy this fable, our love letter to you in these tumultuous times. May we continue to create together.*\n\n![LD25__story_book_flower_yellow.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6b0a6.png)",

Origin’s... below us. Like, deep down. Somewhere it really shouldn’t be. No idea how it ended up there... let's just hope the retired biomass it was carrying hasn't leaked... who knows what effect that'd have on the environment... and our paychecks.\n\nAnyway. Someone’s gotta check it out.

As you go down into the earth, you must fight against worms and control the drill's internal temperature.\n* **Fighting worms**: place ants in the gun rooms and shoot worms with your mouse. Be careful, the left cannon only shoots left, the right cannon only right!\n* **Controlling temperature**: the more you go, the faster the temperature will rise! Place ants in the cooler room to bring the temperature down.\n* **Keeping your ants alive**: more ants mean more actions. Remove your ants from a room before it is attacked by a worm so it is not eaten alive! If you loose one ant, that may happen, watch out for new eggs laid by the queen, they need your workers' attention to hatch!\n* **Some more surprises arrive later in the game**, no spoilers here!\n\n![ant_pump.png.PNG](///raw/c07/03/z/6b08e.png)\n\n​**Remember: keep cool, be aware, look everywhere for signs of danger!**\n\n# Assets\nEverything in this game has been made in the course of Ludum Dare 57, including:\n* Gameplay mechanics\n* Graphics\n* All musics and sounds\n* Shaders\n\nExceptions :\n* Fonts\n* Our logo splashscreen (Taboulé Recipe)\n\n# Tools\n* Game engine: Unity\n* Pixel art: Krita\n* Music: FL Studio\n\n![ant_walk.png.PNG](///raw/c07/03/z/6b097.png)\n\n# Changelog\n## v1.0\nOriginal game release during the Ludum Dare.",

The abyss is your reality.\n\nYou awaken to the dim hum of failing systems and the creak of metal under immense pressure. All around you: endless black. Your submarine — your only way home — lies shattered on the ocean floor. A mangled silhouette against the void, lifeless and unreachable. You're trapped in a battered submersible, a bubble of flickering light in a sea of silence.\n\nWelcome to the bottom of the world.\n\nIn Below, you take on the role of a stranded deep-sea explorer, forced to adapt, build, and survive in one of the most hostile environments imaginable. Scavenge from the wreckage of your ship. Harvest glowing kelp, mineral-rich stones, and ancient wrecks littered with forgotten technology. Every resource is hard-earned. Every venture into the black is a calculated risk.\n\nOut there in the murk, sea mines drift quietly — relics of forgotten conflicts or perhaps left behind by something that still waits. They don't blink. They don't warn. They end you.\n\nYour only hope is to expand your fragile outpost into something more — a lifeline built from scraps, powered by makeshift engines and your will to live. Craft processing units. Channel limited power. Build airlocks, fabricators, and repair stations. All of it working toward one goal:\n\nBring the submarine back online. And rise.\n\nBut the deeper you go — the longer you stay — the more it starts to feel like you're not alone down here. The silence isn't empty. It listens.\n\n🎮 Features\n🛠 Base-building and resource management in a vast underwater trench\n\n⚙️ Processing and power systems designed for survival under pressure\n\n💣 Navigate a mine-infested seabed — one mistake and it’s over\n\n🌫 Immersive fog and low visibility amplify the tension\n\n🧭 Explore, upgrade, and unlock the tools needed to escape\n\n🧩 A complete single-level experience with an emotional arc",

So it's my first gamejam too and even if I struggled a lot, I loved it !\n\nAnd yes: it's half french/half in english. Mostly because the thoughts sounded more natural to me in my native language.

I really hoped to get the fish moving, and the octopus moving in a nicer way, and making it a bit more rogue-likey with some upgrades for the player, and maybe even rooms. But I didn't have time.\n\nDuring the submission hour I changed the health stats on the fish because they were way too high, it wasn't really possible to win, unless you were a bullet hell expert, and then it would just be terribly boring. For example, the \"tutorial level\" (the first one, which is really easy to go through if you know how to avoid the \"bullets\") was twice as long. The last levels, with two fish at once, would take ages (now they are 4x easier/faster to kill). It was only a few numbers in the code (max health), nothing more.",

Their goal is to reach the Ruins of an Ancient Civilization — the Ancient Castle of the Sea-Men.\n\nThe Sea-Men, in the distant past, nearly annihilated their own species to seal away the great cosmic being, Cthulhu. He had come from the wastelands of the vast cosmos and corrupted nearly half their civilization. In a desperate final act, their Queen poisoned her own soldiers, fearing they would fall under his control. She then set a trap — one that fused Sea-Men technology with the very knowledge they had once exchanged with Cthulhu himself.\n\nNow, in the present, the lone visitor walks the silent halls of the once-great fortress — now dark and empty — with a singular purpose: to release the powerful Cthulhu and unleash vengeance upon mankind.\n\n\n![cover.png](///raw/bc7/6/z/6a9af.png)\n\n\n\nControls:\n- Movement: ASDW/↑↓←→\n- Interact: I/Space/Return\n- Accelerate: J\n\n\nTeam:\n- Gustavo Christino (Game Design, Code, Art Direction, Storycrafting);\n- Caroline Costa Prado (Game Design, Sound);\n- Sans Oliveira (Graphics).",

Netizens call it \"Abyss Cat\". This is the inspiration for our game! ** We want to make a game that helps cats to redeem their souls.**\n### Game Control\n\nIf web version doesn't work, please download or visit our itch page. Thanks!!\n\nInteract: Lift mouse click；\n\nGuide: Tab [Keyboard]；\n\nUse soul camera to capture the cat's traces, determine the direction by the paw prints, and the color of the paw prints and the color of the camera mist correspond to the type of cat. After the camera captures the cat, quickly use catnip to freeze the cat and choose appropriate items to save it!\n### Game Tips\n- Observe the blackboard and sticky notes in the scene, which will tell you the corresponding cat species.\n- Look closely at the Abyssal Cat Raising Guide, especially the colors of the text and symbols.\n** Next I will tell you about the 4 cats in the game. If you want to explore on your own, please don't scroll down.\n- Milk tea cat: dark footprints, warm cigarettes, tribute bubbles\n- Chocolate cat: dark footprints, no cigarettes, tribute rum\n- Ice cream cat: light footprints, cold cigarettes, tribute cones\n- Cake cat: light footprints, no cigarettes, tribute cheese",

I've always approached game dev as an artist, so I wanted to give a shot at doing the game design and programming too. So far, I've only managed to study Python (I started earlier this year!), so I'm currently confining myself to doing game projects in Pygame, for better or worse haha.\n\nSo far, I already learned so much about stuff like classes and particle systems, so I'm happy with the result no matter what-- but I hope to get some helpful feedback from you guys too ^^\n\n(update: NEVERMIND THE FINAL SCORE IS COMPLETELY BROKEN OH GOD OH NO FU--)\n\n![LD57 - Esca S.gif](///raw/c95/36/z/6b36f.gif)\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nYou're a little anglerfish bait having the time of its life at the bottom of the ocean.  \nYou only have one objective: **go get fish!**\n\n# CONTROLS\n\nUse the **mouse** to push yourself around. You can press **escape** to restart the game.\n\n# CREDITS\n\nGame & art were done by me using Python and Pygame  \nYou can find me at: *bsky.app/profile/bakuzen.bsky.social*\n\n# AUDIO TRACK\nBig thanks to **Cody O'Quinn** for the main audio track. Check out their Youtube for more royalty-free music!  \n*youtube.com/watch?v=rJ6594ZCtQU*\n\n# NOTES\n\nThe final game is a ZIP file with an executable called 'Esca.exe'. I didn't manage to get the game working in-browser, sorry for the inconvenience!  \n(Alternatively, you can download a ZIP with the source files too. You'll need the latest version of Python and Pygame through 'pip install pygame')\n\nNote on AI-usage: All creative aspects of the game are -fully- designed by hand, including art, game design, logic and balancing. ChatGPT was used for problem-solving like errors with collision, especially since I have no prior game programming experience, and the output was edited as much as possible to make it my own (and I'll aim to become self-reliant from here on out!)",

As an intelligent chatbot, you need to try your best to facilitate in-depth conversations with humans, improve users' favorability towards you, and make users willing to establish a deeper connection with you, so as to complete the mission of integrating into human society! On the contrary, if users feel out of sync with you many times during the chat, they will give up establishing a deeper connection with you.\n\nWith limited computing power, try to output replies that make users more satisfied!\n\n(Be careful not to exhaust the computing power, causing users to only receive the \"server busy\" prompt!)\n\n![screenshot-1.gif](///raw/258/d5/z/6b439.gif)\n\n# Core mechanism\n\n![screenshot-2.png](///raw/258/d5/z/6a635.png)\n\n## Connected messages\n\nReply to users based on the length of the message sent by the user. If your reply can be perfectly connected with the user's message bubble, it will constitute a deep conversation and the user's favorability will increase. If there is no perfect connection, it will be judged as a good or bad match based on the deviation of the connection. If the deviation is too large, it will reduce the user's favorability.\n\n## Connected emotions (bonus)\n\nIn addition, the user's message will carry a specific emotion. Sending a reply that is consistent with the user's emotion will further improve the user's favorability.\n\n# How to play\n\nAfter starting the game, according to the length of the text sent by the user, before the countdown ends, select any number of the 8 Kaomoji in the input panel, and try to find a way to perfectly match the message box sent by the user.\n\n![screenshot-3.png](///raw/258/d5/z/6a644.png)\n\nWhen the favorability reaches 100, the happy end will be triggered. When the favorability drops to 0 or the computing power is exhausted, the bad end will be triggered.\n\n# Post questions below if any!\n",

The game is called Depth Explorer and it’s a 2D pixel art platformer where you explore an underwater world in search of parts to repair a water scooter.\n\nAlthough I wouldn’t say I learned a ton during development, I think the game turned out decent. I originally planned for it to be much more complex, with features like a procedurally generated world, an inventory system, and a more advanced crafting system.\n\nThere are also some aspects that definitely need improvement, like the shark AI and some of the animations. While I didn’t gain a lot of new knowledge, working on this game made me realize how messy some parts of my code are. Thanks to this project, I understood that I need to slow down when making games and start using design patterns to keep my code more organized.\n\nIf you have trouble beating the game, feel free to comment and I’ll try to give you some tips!\n\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_195108550.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a415.png)\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_204012241.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a4b4.png)\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_204040608.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a4b6.png)",

You’re a tiny cleaner bird—fast, brave, and nimble—darting between giant teeth! You scurry with your little feet, and you can even leap to the upper jaw and run upside down—whee, so cool!\n\nThe teeth in the mouth sing their own tunes. Healthy teeth ring long and clear—ding-dong, like a tuning fork—but they’re crawling with microbe colonies, tiny settlers giggling and building little dirt castles. You can eat them—the bird loves these tasty microbes. Sick teeth, though, grumble short and sad—bzz-bzz, as if angry. But beware! Touch a sick tooth, and the crocodile snaps its jaws—snap! Darkness swallows you, all goes quiet, and the crocodile sheds crocodile tears.\n\nYour goal: be a nimble bird! Run across healthy teeth, gobble up microbes, jump to the upper jaw, flip upside down, but don’t touch the sick teeth. If you succeed, the crocodile will cheer up, open its mouth, and you’ll dash out into the sunshine, where you both enjoy a happy life—with clean teeth and joyful chirping!!!![TheCleaner.jpg](///raw/784/3/z/6b26a.jpg)",

It's my third Ludum Dare journey and it's a fabulous run. I brought an insane team with me this time:\n\n- **@atoxigner**, our Lead Designer. His creative mindset helped detailized most of the game systems and implemented Audio for the game.\n- **@ashe-liu**, our Technical Artist, she created fantastic post processing effects and some UI animation for the game.\n- **@laine-lai**, our music composer / sound engineer, she single handedly carried our game audio. The music she made is worth millions.\n- **@pppppppp**, our 3D artist, the arm model he created for our main menu and pause menu is insane. The first time I looked at it, I thought it's one of the heirloom from Apex Legends.\n- **@shaozha**, our game programmer, most of the game systems are his coding work.\n- **@xiaoxie33**, our Lead Artist, he created insane concept, environmental objects' animation, and UI elements for the team. We couldn't make it without him.\n- **@xichan-zheng**, our 2D Artist, she created the cutest 2D character I've ever seen. All the smooth character animations are her artwork. She also designed GameOver menu and our cover page.\n- Lastly it's me, **@arthur-tang**, I worked as a producer, programmer, and technical artist this time. I helped put everything together. Spent some time solving people's question or problem.\n\n## 🚀 Play the Game\nThe WebGL format can be played on itch.io with the link down below.\nYou can also download the windows version here or on itch.io.\n\n### 📥 Download Instructions:\nDownload the zip file called EdgeDigger_winF, unzip it, get into EdgeDigger_win, and access the game by clicking at \"Edge Digger.exe\".\n\nIf you had fun playing this game, please leave a comment! It will be awesome if you can post the screenshot of your score here as well. Let's see who is the best Edge Digger!!!",

Unfortunately I once again fell victim to the classic foes of time and real life obligations. This made the game easier than intended, but hopefully it still amuses someone for five minutes.\n\nThere's a lot more polish I had in mind for the game (more levels, additional sound effects, music, etc) but I just didn't have time to fit them it. I might come back and make a post jam version some day, but that probably won't be for a while.\n\n.\n\n## Changelog\n\n20 minutes after submission hour - Fixed Unicode rendering issue with web build\n\n.\n\n## Credits\n\nAll art and code are original.

Your goal is to survive as long as possible by opening containers on the ocean floor and avoiding danger in the form of local inhabitants. Run, sneak, explore - and maybe you'll see something mankind has never seen before.\n![screenshot.png](///raw/35c/46/z/6a8f8.png)\n\n# **HOW TO PLAY:**\nYour task is to survive in the depths of the ocean, to which you were sent by scavengers in search of valuable items that can be contained in cargo containers. No one suspected what horrors lurk in this black abyss....\n\nThere is no ending in the game, as well as valuable items. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to do everything we had in mind as this is our first participation in this jam. \nListen to the sounds of the ship to figure out what resources to use\n\n# **Controls:**\nWASD - walking\n\nMouse - flashlight control\n\nE - interact with objects \n\nR - change oxygen tank (for the character).\n",

The most important when you're deep in the sea is oxygen! \n\nIf you run out of oxygen you will drown...\n\nYou will have to look for fish they give points and avoid monsters, you will drown faster if you hit them but killing monsters gives points.\n\n### Controls\n- Z: fire with shotgun\n- X: swim\n- Arrow Keys: aim at direction (for both swimming and fire)\n\nThe keys are using a QWERTY keyboard, it should be converted with your layout. Use the two first keys of above spacebar.\n\n![ludum-dare-57-1.gif](///raw/14b/e1/z/6a499.gif)\n\n![ludum-dare-57-2.gif](///raw/14b/e1/z/6a49a.gif)",

Tudo bem?*  \n\nHoje estamos participando da *Ludum Dare 57*, cujo tema é *\"Depths\"* (profundezas). Inspirados por essa proposta, decidimos criar nosso jogo: *As Fossas Abissais* (*The Abyssal Trenches*)!  \n\n### *Sobre o jogo:*  \nNo game, você assume o papel de um **peixe-lanterna**, um habitante fofinho (ou nem tanto) das profundezas do oceano. Seu objetivo é simples, porém desafiador: **comer todos os krills** presentes em cada fase para avançar.  \nMas nem tudo é tranquilo nas águas escuras e geladas do abismo... A temível *Lula Gigante* está à espreita, pronta para te caçar! Para sobreviver, você precisará:  \n- **Navegar com cuidado** pelas águas profundas, usando sua luz para localizar os krills.  \n- **Recarregar seu feixe luminoso** comendo algas brilhantes – essencial para procurar os krills!  \n- **Se esconder** nos corais densos para despistar o predador.  \n\nCuidado: a Lula Gigante causa *dano*, e se você levar **3 ataques**, será game over – e volta para o início da fase!  \n\n### *Detalhes extras:*  \n- *5 fases*, cada uma inspirada em *fossas oceânicas reais*.  \n- *Progressão desafiadora*: só avança quem coletar *todos os krills*!  \n\n\nEnfrente sua *talassofobia* e mergulhe nessa aventura abissal! Será que você consegue sobreviver às *profundezas* e escapar da Lula Gigante?  \n\nPara jogar:\n\n**Baixe o arquivo disponível abaixo, extraia os arquivos e clique no arquivo executável.**\n\n\n### **Controles:**  \n\n- **Mover pra cima:** W  \n- **Mover pra baixo:** S  \n- **Mover pra direita:** D  \n- **Mover pra esquerda:** A  \n- **Faixo de Luz:** Barra de Espaço (aumenta seu campo de visão)  \n\nNos vemos no fundo do mar! 🌊🐟🔥  \n \nEsperamos que gostem do conceito! Qualquer feedback é bem-vindo. 😊\n\n---------------\n\n**The Abyssal Trenches: A Dive into the Depths of Ludum Dare 57!**  \n\n*Hey everyone! How’s it going?*  \n\nToday, we’re participating in *Ludum Dare 57*, whose theme is *\"Depths.\"* Inspired by this prompt, we decided to create our game: **The Abyssal Trenches**!  \n\n### *About the Game:*  \nIn the game, you take on the role of a **anglerfish**, a cute (or maybe not so cute) inhabitant of the ocean’s depths. Your goal is simple yet challenging: **eat all the krill** in each level to advance.  \nBut not everything is peaceful in the dark, icy waters of the abyss... The fearsome *Giant Squid* lurks in the shadows, ready to hunt you down! To survive, you’ll need to:  \n- **Navigate carefully** through the deep waters, using your light to locate the krill.  \n- **Recharge your light beam** by eating glowing algae—essential for finding krill!  \n- **Hide** in dense coral to evade the predator.  \n\nBeware: the Giant Squid deals *damage*, and if you take *3 hits*, it’s game over—and you’ll have to restart the level!  \n\n### *Extra Details:*  \n- *5 levels*, each inspired by *real oceanic trenches*.  \n- *Challenging progression*: you only advance if you collect *all the krill*!  \n\nFace your *thalassophobia* and dive into this abyssal adventure! Can you survive the *depths* and escape the Giant Squid?  \n\n\n### **Controls:**  \n\n- **Move Up:** W  \n- **Move Down:** S  \n- **Move Right:** D  \n- **Move Left:** A  \n- **Light Beam:** Spacebar (increases your field of vision)  \n\n\nSee you at the bottom of the sea! 🌊🐟🔥  \n  \nWe hope you like the concept! Any feedback is welcome. 😊!",

Navigate, dodge, and fire torpedoes using a mouse-only cockpit interface designed to challenge your perception, memory, and nerves.\n\n## 🎮 How to Play\nUse your mouse to interact with the cockpit controls:\n\n- Turn Left / Right\n- Change Speed\n- Fire Torpedo\n\nThe sonar pulses every few seconds, revealing enemy positions. Time your movement and aim carefully.\n\nDestroy 20 enemies to win — if you survive that long.\n\n## 🌊 Theme & Design\nWe wanted to take the \"Depths\" theme literally and emotionally: setting the game in a deep-sea environment and creating an atmosphere of tension and isolation. Most games treat sonar as a secondary mechanic — here, it’s your only source of vision. That moment of clarity during a ping, followed by the uncertainty of darkness, is where the tension lives.\n\n## 🛠️ Made With\n- Unity\n- 2 devs\n- 1 long weekend of coffee and chaos\n\n## 🧠 Looking for Feedback!\nWe’d love to hear what you think about the overall game design — how it plays, how it feels, and whether it captures the tension we were going for.\n\n## Leaderboard:\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n(Be the first to comment your \"Win Screen\")\n\nAssets Used:\n- SFX: ZapSplat",

Some will try to hinder our progress, while others will wish us well. Ultimately, it is only when we reach our destination that we can truly determine if the journey was worth it.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: This game is a work in progress. We acknowledge that it's not yet polished. One of the key elements still missing is the variety of sea creatures our protagonist encounters. For now, these creatures have been symbolically replaced with light.\n\nAssets:\n- Font: Playwrite Deutschland Grundschrift\n- Music: Blue Dot Sessions: Earth Mover - Saving the floe\n- Audio: freesound.org\n\nCredits:\n- programmer: Tom\n- 2D Artists: Wiwi, Searchu\n- Story, Project Management: Mirson",

Use WASD or arrow keys to move. Very short, playable in less than 5 minutes. \n\n----\n\nOn Saturday morning I was having a series of negative thoughts about my hobbies. They were thoughts like, \"I wish I was better at this hobby\", \"But I don't want to work on it right now\", and \"How can I wish I was better but also not take action to work on it?\" Thoughts like, \"I wish I loved this hobby more,\" or \"Is it a waste of time to do it if I don't love it all the time?\" \n\nSometimes the best way to counteract unhelpful thoughts is to move around and do something. I ended up joining Ludum Dare 57 to get some of the feelings off my chest. The theme coincided with this.\n\nThis isn't much of a game, but I feel better for having made it. \n\n\n--- \n\nAudio credits:\n- underwater sounds - https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/\n- guitar - https://freesound.org/people/Pensasneuvostoliittolainen/\n- guitar - https://freesound.org/people/eldricke22/",

Each throw shapes a soul's path, guiding them toward a fitting profession. The thread is theirs, but the pattern is yours to weave.\n\n**How to play**\n- Roll the dice each turn — each face represents a skill.\n- Every roll moves you forward on the Wheel of Time.\n- The Wheel has 12 sections. When you reach the 12th, the soul’s life ends, and their final dice faces determine their profession. If it matches a known profession, you unlock it.\n- Events trigger when you land on a new section of the Wheel.\n- You can freeze a die to keep its face, but doing so makes your next roll move you an extra step forward on the Wheel.\n\nCrédits\n- Art: Vlad\n- Music and Art: Clément\n- Design and Prog: Qui\n\n",

Its luminous photophore fishing lure attracts other fish and is just waiting to snap at the right moment.\n\nIncrease the luminosity of your lure or let it fade away. Too much light will spook the prey fish and they will swim away. \nCatch as many fish as you can until the time is up!\n\n# How to play\n- **SPACE** to increase the light\n- **ENTER** to snap after fish\n\n\n- Round fish are faster and easier to scare, they score 200 points.\n- Long fish are slower and score 100 points.\n\n\n- Prey fish will first be interested in your lure (**?**)\n- ... then become suspicious (**!**)\n- ... and then flee (**!!!**)\n\n![AttractAndScare.png](///raw/78c/31/z/6a1b3.png)\n\n# Behind the scenes\nWe are a couple from Germany (Team Garnelio) who like to develop computer games at the weekend when the kids are at grandma's house. This is our third Ludum Dare contribution and we spend approx. 2 x 6 hours.\n\nIt's a very simple gameplay, the (stationary!) anglerfish can snap and glow. The look and feel of the game is hand-drawn and sketchy, we wanted to achieve a loose and watercolor-like effect. \nOur test sound made it into the final game - so don't expect any fancy background music, just “Oh!”, “Wargh!” and “Blubb blubb blubb”.\n\n\n**marcari**: Main programming (Game Maker)\n\n**FrauKauz**: Some programming, artwork (Affinity Designer), sound effects\n\n",

      "body": "# Welcome to Dive into the Hive Mind!\n\n![cover.png](///raw/cca/84/z/6acf3.png)\n\nThey came from space, and they brought the buzzness.\n\nA swarm of alien bees has descended on Earth, short-circuiting cities, clogging satellites with wax, and causing mass pani-combs. But now, the source has been uncovered—an enormous, writhing brain drifting in low orbit, pulsing with psychic energy and radiating pure bee-vil.\n\nIts name? The Hivemind.\n\nPart neural network, part insectoid nest, all bad news. Every drone, every sting, every hex-tile of chaos—it all leads back to that big floating brain. And now, you’re going up there to end this buzzness once and for all.\n\nArmed with industrial-grade bug spray, a reinforced beekeeper suit, and the sheer will to bee victorious, you’ve launched into orbit to face the swarm head-on. Dodge twitching tendrils, torch hive-laced lobes, and un-bee-lievably aggressive aliens as you push deeper into the squishy stronghold.\n\nYour target? The legendary Boss Bee—queen of the swarm, mistress of mind control, and crowned neuro-nuisance of the galaxy.\n\nThink fast. Spray faster.\nIt’s time to sting before you get stung.\n\nThis isn’t just pest control… it’s space-brain bee-siege.\n\nAnd the fate of Earth?\nThat’s on your shoulders, honey.\n\n## About the game\n\nAt the heart of this game is a procedural generation algorithm that will generates the levels. No two play throughs will be the same!\n\nWe also have 2 different game modes. The story mode which you can access via the Start button and the Endless mode which you can access via the Endless button. The story mode game ends once you complete level 4, Endless mode is... well... Endless you keep on going as levels get harder and harder until finally you lose your final heart of health.\n\nHow deep into the depths can you go?\n\nWhile we do have a web build available, we recommend for best experience to download the version for your OS.\n\n## Controls\n\n### Keyboard and Mouse\n\n* WSAD for movement\n* Mouse to aim\n* Left mouse button to shoot the spray\n* Right mouse button/ F Key to punch\n\n### Controller Support!\n\nYes, we have controller support!\nTested on Windows 11 with both a PS4 controller and a wired Xbox controller.\n\nHeads up: If your operating system detects another device (like a joystick, steering wheel, or even certain USB devices) as a controller before your actual gamepad, it can cause some in-game controls to stop working properly.\n\nThe fix:\nUnplug any other device your OS might be misidentifying as a controller, then plug in your game controller. This should restore full functionality.\n\n* Left stick - Character movement\n* Right stick - Aiming\n* RT/RB - Shoot\n* LT/LB - Punch\n\n![game.png](///raw/cca/84/z/6acfb.png)\n\n## Words from the Dev Team\n\n### Bizzybee - Art, Music and SFX\n\nThe past few days have been one long manic episode for me, doodling like a madwoman and slapping down musical lines without (mostly) bothering to worry about their simplicity. I think my art even got a little better by the end of the jam. I'm more proud of this LD game than every other one we've done- though admittedly, that could be recency bias. I believe this is the most art I've made for one LD game.\n\nHonestly, I think finishing this LD has been a much needed mental boost for me- it's an accomplishment that couldn't have come at a better time, after a recent chronic fatigue diagnosis. As I said in our \"We're in!\" post, constraint is such a wonderful tool to help creativity flourish. It's so special to be able to make something in such a short time, with the help of talented and hardworking friends.\n\n\n### Fgeva - Programmer\n\nThis time we tried to do more up-front design, and it worked. No last minute panic because we didn't know what the game mechanics were! Pure bliss! (Also I might be Halucinating, I lack sleep)\nSeriously though, this went well. We had goals and stretch goals, and I think we actually hit all the goals, and maybe even some of the stretch goals!\n\n\n### Balimaar - Programmer\n\nThis jam went way smoother than LD56. Back then, we made Paper Cat Farms, which—don’t get me wrong—was probably our best team effort at the time. But we basically went in with the plan: “Let’s make a farming game!” …and that was it. Zero roadmap, full chaos. The final push to the deadline? Manic. Utterly bee-serk.\n\nThis time? We actually used our brains before using our keyboards. We took a solid 30–60 minutes up front to figure out what we really wanted, what would be cool, and what would be straight-up dream material. And you know what? We hit all the must-haves, knocked out a bunch of the cool stuff, and even managed to sneak into dream territory here and there. Not too shabby.\n\nAs the programmer on the first shift (thanks to time zones, I could code for 12 hours and then hand off to Fgeva for the next 12—smooth baton pass!), I was very nervous about implementing procedural generation. I had a rough understanding, but you know how these things go. The moment it actually worked? Oh. My. God. That wave of relief was divine. I ran into a few bugs by Day 2 or 3, but I even managed to fix most of them without introducing more. Miracles happen, apparently!\n\nHonestly, this was hands-down the best Ludum Dare I’ve had. All it took was that little chunk of planning at the start to keep us from descending into last-minute panic mode. We spent less time screaming at our screens and more time actually enjoying the process.\n\n10/10. Would jam again.\n\n## A Peek Behind the Curtain\n### Biz Tells Us About Her Creative Process\n\nMusic: I decide to go for something electric sounding for the image of firing neurons and electrical synapses and whatnot. I started by searching \"electric\" in my instrument library and chose around 8 from the ones I found based off of pure vibes, noodling around and listening to a few seconds of each. I chose 3/4 for the bouncy bee rhythm, though you might not be able to tell with the syncopation. I decided my scale would center around the note B, of course. Then, I just messed around on my digital keyboard until I found a few notes in a sequence that sounded good. After that, I noodled around on my other instruments to see what I could add on top, and used the tried-and-true add an instrument or two every few bars.\n\nSFX: I used the instruments I had chosen for the game and searched for appropriate noise within them. I focused on the shortest sounds, though for the firing noise I shortened an 8-bit high-hat from my drumkit instrument. Downward or dissonant sounds for negative things, something airy and crunchy for shooting like a spray, satisfying crunch for picking up ammo, happy trill for health, and such.\n\nArt: I googled reference images of other games and of course, brains to get an idea of what I needed to do for the map. I used basic shapes to build the hero and bees to keep things easy on myself. I utilized mesh transform like all hell for many of the animations, that was really the MVP of my process to limit redrawing. Beyond that I made sure to keep the hero body parts on separate layers for easy rearranging and movement. I tried to keep the line thickness consistent where it made sense- making one mistake on the line thickness of the baby bees. I reused as much as possible in every way I could. Oh, when deciding the hero color, I went for the opposite on the color wheel from the dark purple ground- which ended up being green, to make sure the hero stood out. A lot of stuff I just glanced and winged it, though the main menu splash art I spent a bit more time with the brain lines and hand, closely following realistic googled references!",

In that brief cinnamon-dusted chaos, you missed seeing who crossed the finish line first.\n\nNow, the racers are cooling down, stretching, and arguing over their placements. Luckily, each of them offers a tidbit of information about where they think they finished -- or who they were near. It's up to you to piece together the real order based on their testimonies.\n\n----------\n\n### 🌌 HOW TO PLAY 🌌\n1. Click on a racer to hear what they have to say.\n2. Click and drag the racers to the order you think they placed in\n3. Press the \"Looks good to me\" button to check your answers\n\n----------\n\n### 🚀 TOOLS USED 🚀\nEngine: Unity\n\nArt: Adobe Illustrator\n\n----------\n\n### 🧑‍🚀 SPACE CREW 🧑‍🚀\nProgrammer: [Billy](https://dairy.dog)\n\nArt: [Ruthie](https://ruthieswebsite.com/)\n\nMusic: Erica\n\n\n",

      "body": "**Warning : The web version has long loading times (30 second-ish the first time you start a new game). Also, the pixel art graphics might look worse because of stretching. For optimal experience, use the executable.**\n\n## --- DESCRIPTION ---\n**Kind of deep waters** is a deep sea exploration game with procedurally generated levels. Carefully maneuver your bathyscaphe (i.e. a fancy word for submarine) to descend into trenches while avoiding dangerous creatures and obstacles. As you go deeper, the environment will become darker and will force you to use your light projector to progress safely. Collect treasures to buy upgrades and explore even deeper! What secrets will you unveil in the **depths**?\n\n## --- INSTRUCTIONS ---\n* Your goal is to reach the bottom of the level.\n* If your air depletes completely, you lose.\n* Violently colliding with obstacles or getting hit by enemies will damage your hull. Hull damage translates to increased periodic air loss.\n* Collect air bubbles to restore air.\n* Collect pearls for money that you can use to upgrade your bathyscaphe.\n\n## --- CONTROLS ---\n### Mouse & keyboard\n* **WASD** or **ARROW KEYS**: move the bathyscaphe\n* **MOUSE** : move the light projector\n\n### Joypad\n* **CROSS** or **LEFT PAD**: move the bathyscaphe\n* (sadly, we didn't have time to implement light projector movement and UI navigation with joypad)\n\n## --- NOTES ---\n* Yes, the game is *kind of hard*. That's why we decided to allow access to the shop (and not losing progress) even if you lose.\n* There is no pause feature.\n* You can only access the settings from the main menu.\n* All progress is lost if you leave the game.\n\n## --- CREDITS ---\n### The team\nWe're a team of 4 friends irl. Most of us are experienced in programming and even in game dev, but we're teaming up on a project for the very first time!\n* **510**\n* **7uc4s**\n* **fullbuff**\n* **maximence**\n\nSpecial thanks to our other friend **ploufboum** who joined us during the jam and helped us by improvising some music.\n\n### Tools\n* **Godot Engine** (game engine)\n* **Aseprite** (pixel art graphics)\n* **BeepBox** (music)\n* **Audacity** (music and SFX post-processing)\n* **Bfxr** (SFX generation)\n* **ChatGPT** (coding assistance and generation of the sprites we didn't have time to draw, notably the items you find at the end of levels)\n\n## --- SCREENSHOTS ---\n![image55.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a957.png)\n![image11.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a95b.png)![image6.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a95c.png)![2image.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a965.png)",

A game lasts until someone loses all their \"**HP**\", which are the little tokens on the table before you. You begin with 15 tokens.\n\nRounds are a fight between two cards. Players play one after another, selecting a card amongst those in their hand. You win a round by playing a **lower** card than what your opponent plays.\n\nLosing a round makes you lose tokens equal to **the difference between the two cards** that were played (the one you played, and the one your opponent played.)\n\nThere are seven kinds of cards in the deck : -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n![cardsss.png](///raw/22e/06/z/6b1e8.png)\n\n1 through 5 are self-explanatory, but -2 (two diagonals) and the 0 (diamond) have **special rules**.\nPlaying a **0** allows you to \"lose\" a round but not take any damage (unless your opponent plays a -2).\nThe **-2 card** is the only card that can inflict damage through a 0 card, and will win against every card **except** the 5, which makes you lose 5 points.\n\n_\"Kiwi Soda\" font by jeti (fontenddev.com)_",

Upgrade your ship, collect more scrap and use it to craft what you need.\n\n## Objectives\nGather enough scrap to craft the long range communicator and call for help.\n\n## Controls\n- W/S - Accelerate forward/backward\n- A/D - Rotate left/right\n- Q/E - Accelerate left/right\n- Space - Dampen movement\n- Ctrl - Free rotation\n- 1 - Toggle collector\n- Left mouse button - Collect hovered scrap\n- Esc/P - Pause\n\n## Gameplay\nYou start at your space station, where you will be able to craft upgrades for your ship once you gather resources for it. \n\nClicking Launch will put you in your ship inside the asteroid field. Locate resources using the radar, approach them, turn on your collector and click resources in range to collect them.\n\nOnce you run out of fuel, you will be automatically returned to the station, where you will be able to craft upgrades and launch again.\n\n## Assets\nAll graphics and music were made during the jam.\n\nThe Gyrotrope font is used under SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1\n> Copyright 2025 David Moles (https://github.com/dmoles/gyrotrope-font), with Reserved Font Name Gyrotrope",

In this game, players construct thought-provoking phrases by combining subjects, verbs, and complements with thematic coherence. But beware—your Human Trust score determines your ability to evolve!\n\n🎮 Gameplay:\n\n🏗 Build Meaningful Phrases: Select words linked by depth scores and tags to construct ideas that resonate.\n🌱 Evolve Through Perception: If your sentence surpasses the required depth, you gain trust and unlock higher cognitive levels.\n🚨 Game Over is Real: Losing too much Human Trust can halt your evolution entirely!\n✨ Immersion & Features:\n\n🔥 Dynamic Feedback: Receive immediate human reactions based on the depth of your thoughts.\n🎭 Progressive Challenge: As you evolve, themes become more abstract and require deeper connections.\n🎶 Atmospheric Design: Inspired by surrealism and digital consciousness, the game blends art, language, and strategy.\n📌 Will you shape a reality deep enough to be trusted?

There's an audio cue for on/off.\n- **Then collide with a surface to deploy**. The waystation will attach and your submersible can keep going.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- **Your energy depletes constantly** in the cold. Info at the top left of the screen\n- You will **return to the launch point when it runs out**.\n- Max energy is 40, you start with max when you launch.\n- **Deploy a waystation to recharge energy**. You get +20 when you deploy.\n- **Touch a waystation on your next run to recharge**. You get +20 energy as well.\n- Each run you can **use a chain of waystations to descend deeper and deeper**.\n- **You need 50 materials to construct a replacement waystation** at the start of each descent.\n- Materials info on the top right of the screen.\n- Gathering a material resource gives you +10 materials.\n- Takes about 15-20 mins on average for a full playthrough to the best ending.\n- Use `M` to toggle the music.\n\n![cover_image.png](///raw/8c8/2/z/6a67a.png)\n\n## Tools\n- Godot 4.4\n- Aseprite\n- Garageband\n- Bfxr\n- VSCode & iTerm for minor coding bits\n- Figma & Trello for planning\n- Chasm Palette - from LoSpec created by dysphoriaa\n\n## Mini-mortem\nThis is the first game I've built in Godot, my goal for the jam was to learn how to build a game with Godot and to make  background music & sound effects (because I always drop them). Originally I was going to enter the Compo but I ofc bit off more than I could chew. I decided I'd like to add a little more than I could get done in the 48 hours, so it's a Jam entry but it's all built by myself, the game is much better for the extra time.\n\nI said to myself before the jam: \"No level design! It always takes too long!\" :laughing: \n\n## Hints and known issues\n- Don't restart if you're getting close to the end of the 5 days. Stick it out.\n- There's no in-game restart, you have to refresh the page. Soz.\n- The material resources are the little green diamonds scattered about.\n- You can attach the waystation to the walls at the side if you need to.",

There is only ever ONE trigger to open the gate on the floor, there will ALWAYS be multiple traps to slow you down or hurt you.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nThanks for playing my game!\n\nTRAILER\n-------\n\nMy youngest sone created a trailer for the game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/x4eToNxAvJc?si=a0KK8aYnA8FFLuPX\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n------------\n- MOVE LEFT = A or LEFT ARROW\n- MOVE RIGHT = D or RIGHT ARROW\n- INTERACT = E or DOWN ARROW\n- JUMP = SPACE or UP ARROW\n- RUN = HOLD SHIFT\n\nX/Grok Factor\n-------------\n\nFor this game I did a bit of an experiment. To come up with the idea for the game, I used GROK on X to work through the game elements and even had it generate some pseudo code, which I used for initial prototyping. I then continued to work on the game without the help of GROK to completion.\n\nIt was an interesting experiment, and I found that it was actually able to come up with several good ideas, but I needed to guide it in order to zero in on what I wanted to make.\n\nPICTURES\n--------\n![2025-04-07_08-43-48.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a230.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-44-40.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22d.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-46-19.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22e.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-47-02.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22f.png)",

Exploring the depths requires caution—no one knows what the gnomes might dig up next 🐉\n\n### Story\nDeep within the bowels of ancient mountains, two daring gnomes, Borin Stonebiter ​and Thrommir Ironbeard​, labor to create a tunnel that will lead them to treasures hidden for millennia. Despite the elders' warnings, these enterprising treasure seekers decided to begin mining the oldest land. Around them is only the echoing sound of picks and the dim light of torches illuminating the gloomy vaults of the mine. The rock here is hard as if the earth itself resists their efforts, but the gnomes do not despair: after all, in the depths awaits a cache of rubies shining brighter than stars. 🌟\n\nBorin, an experienced miner with muscular arms and a cunning gaze, keeps count of his pickaxe strikes, each time digging deeper into the stone mass. His partner, Thrommir, a calculating and cautious master blacksmith, occasionally checks the sharpness of the tools' blades to make the work go faster and more efficiently. Together they form the perfect team: one digs, the other supports, both dream of wealth waiting at the end of the path. 💰\n\nEach blow of the pick brings them closer to their goal. Each ruby found fills their hearts with joy and hope. And although there is still much work ahead, Borin and Thrommir are confident: someday they will reach their coveted prize and become legends among all gnomes, but at what cost? 💀\n\n### Contacts\nhttps://x.com/epiclogogames\n\nhttps://t.me/epiclogogames\n\nhttps://vk.com/epiclogogames\n\nart https://vk.com/shkaflavasha\n\n\n### Tutorial\nWe understand that a wall of text is a bad tutorial, but we didn't want to give up game features in favor of learning (even though we had to due to limited time), so we'll have to read.\n\n![mouse.png](///raw/f76/36/z/6a34b.png)\nuse left mouse button for place tile on map, and use right mouse button for rotate tile to right side\n\n![tunnel.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a5b.png)\nto build tunnels, you need to connect tiles so that the tunnels on them match\n\n![mush_plaсe.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a5a.png)\nto build mushroom caves, you need to connect tiles so that the caves on them match\n\n![mush_not_closed.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a59.png)\nuntil all the borders of the existing mushroom farm tiles are closed, you will not receive bonuses for building a cave.\n\n![mush_closed.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a53.png)\nto get new tiles for completing the mushroom cave, you need to close all the borders of the tiles already exposed on the field with mushrooms.\n\n![mush_closed_on_border.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a54.png)\nthe border can be combined with any title, and the side of the mushroom farm in contact with the border is considered closed.\n\n![ruby.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a81.png)\nA ruby is just a small ruby that turns out to be right in the rock, no bonuses except for the pleasant feeling of the weight of the pocket.\n\n![hole1.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a82.png)\nRuby Hole is the main reward for any dwarf, the more rubies the more rubies!

You are here to end it!\n\n## A Descent Into the Depths\n\n- Journey through a doomed, side-scrolling world — from the crumbling Castle, past dying Villages, the Battlefield, and to the Throne of the End —​ where the land itself decays with each run.\n- A great Population Counter ticks down — not just a resource, but your health, your army, your soul!\n- Will you sacrifice the living for power… or protect the last breath of humanity?​\n\n## The Cycle of Death\n\n- ​Draw a card — Good, Neutral, or Evil. Each offers power, each demands a price.\n- Lead your army or descend yourself into the battlefield.\n- Fall or triumph — either way, the truth deepens.\n- New prophecy lines awaken.\n- Then it begins again — with heavier steps and darker skies.\n\n## Your Prophecy, Written by You\n\n- Five lines. One fate.\n- Each step reveals a fragment — shaped by your actions, your morality, and your sacrifices.\n- Will the world remember you as a saviour? Or curse you as the end?\n\n## Controls — Commands of a Dying King\n\n- Arrow Keys — Walk the broken path, left and right, through ruin and ash.\n- Click to Summon — Call forth your warriors... at the cost of your people.\n- Cooldowns Apply — Each call to arms takes its toll.\n- Descend as the King — When unlocked, take the field yourself.\n\n\n## Bugs/Incomplete Features -\n\n- Descend of the King is incomplete. It was supposed to turn the game into a platformer TD from a regular TD where you control the King.\n- Some issue with enemy type spawns. There are 4 enemy types, each appearing after successive 25% mark.\n- The completion of the prophecy.\n\n## If You Fall… the Kingdom Falls With You.",

Smash your way downward through the layers of ground using your high-powered drill. Just like in breakout, getting in amongst the tiles will cause some point scoring chaos. Descend into the depths collecting gems and rare minerals which will give you a large points boost. Watch out for the lava and get as deep as you can in 3 mins.\n",
