      "body": "A short colony simulator where you try to lead your little divers to productive ends, like producing energy and oxygen, so that they can keep breathing.\n\nThere is no clear objective to the game, but you'll probably figure out the bounds of the sandbox after playing a little bit. For further details, spoilers: the main objective of the game is to keep the divers alive. For that, they need oxygen, which is produced by divers with the \"Oxygen mechanic\" job. To make oxygen, they need energy, which is produced by divers with the \"Energy producer\" job. There is a third job, \"Hauler\", which can help the other two jobs be more efficient by allowing them to keep working while the hauler moves around the relevant resources. The 3 lines of information on the divers' cards are: Job, Morale, and Oxygen. The job can be changed in the Command Divers menu. If morale falls too low, the diver will go for a walk instead of working to recover some. If oxygen falls too low, the diver will try to find oxygen to refill it. The fun of the game is really just watching the simulation go, didn't manage to add in too much interactivity.\n\nKeyboard and gamepad controls are supported, and the overlay at the bottom explains what the buttons do, but not the mouse (as you might expect from a colony sim).\n\nThe game is also on [itch.io](https://nc.itch.io/oxygen).\n\nJam details: I was originally going for the compo, but needed a bit more time. So the music and art was made by me during the jam. Music with Make Noise's Strega synthesizer (cut and filtered a little with Bitwig Studio), and art with Krita.\n\n![screenshot-01.png](///raw/6e/z/6b07a.png)",

I will use it more from now on.\n\nAs usual, the jam didn't go as expected. Initially I had different ideas, I wanted to make an adventure game using some mechanics derived from different meanings of depth, but ended up with something quite different (though the main mechanic is more or less the same).\n\nOverall I'm satisfied as this time I submitted a \"full\" game, with menus, audio and a whole level. Good enough for the first Ludum Dare. Let's see if I can make it better the next time.\n\n--------------------\n*I say it in plural but there is only one level.

The deeper you get; the less heat will dissipate on its own. Heat exceeding the first quarter of your display will damage the drill over time.\nBut worry not! Repair is on the way. Raise your drills up and move them into the repair bays using your Workstation, stand up and take a look at what‚Äôs wrong. Maybe change a fuse or two.\nRemember: Never despair, always repair!\n\n![Image_Sequence_1_006_0000.png](///raw/19c/36/z/6a8bb.png)\n\nChapter IV: The elevating Chute Experience\nYou can use your Elevator module and lower yourself into the chutes by stepping inside and pressing the right buttons.

To do this you have to empty the Chute from any modules and lower it without the latter to grab it and bring it up to you!\nYou may have heard of mysterious happenings, haven‚Äôt you? ‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù? \nThe good news is, there are none! You are completely safe!\nThe bad news is: someone lied to you.

But if you'd like to know where it started, check it out [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/depths-of-darvaza)! \n\n### How to play\nYou can use either keyboard or gamepad. It should detect both PS5 and Xbox controllers. I haven't tested it with older controllers but they should work.\n\nMove     - Arrow Keys or DPAD/Left Analog stick.  \nShoot    - Z Key or the X button  \nJump     - Space bar or the A button  \nInteract - X Key or the B button   \n\n\n### Story so far...\nDarvasa is home to a corporate mining industry. Recently, there's been an explosion at one of the facilities. It's your job as a member of the Conflict Resolution Outfit Unit to determine the cause of the accident, descend into the depths of Darvasa once again and find the foreman in charge of the operation. If he's still alive... \n\n### Credits\nSkawly for the cover art <3   \nConduit for the voice acting and amazing OST!  \nJeremy and Dalton for hanging out while we worked on the jam.   \nTony for helping me play test the initial build!   \nAND YOU, for taking the time to play my game. Thanks!   \n\n\n\n",

The main culprit was the health restoration hearts were being spawned on an incorrect parent node causing, but not limited to:\n - Random crashes\n - Index out of bounds\n - Layers that should stop spinning to keep spinning\n - Gates to next depth layer not opening when triggered\n - Final boss to not spawn\n - Other misc issues and corrections\n\n\nSince during the Jam we never implemented settings, credits, or how to play, how to play:\n\nMouse to aim, W to move towards mouse, S to move away from mouse. Left mouse for melee attack, right mouse for ranged. There is a short cooldown on melee and you have limited Mana (which regens over time) for ranged attacks.\n\nWhen moving down layers, you will sometimes YEET across the screen, this is due to the game deciding that you were in an unwalkable area and relocating you (sometimes violently) to a walkable area.\n\n\n\nCredits:\nAnneArkey: for creating/modifying miscellaneous graphics to fit the theme we were going for, as well as creating/sourcing all the sound and music for the game.\n\nRubixNoob13: The BIGGEST ball of spaghetti code I've made in a while, however it somehow (mostly) works\n\n- Graphics - \nPublic Domain: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\nBat sprites by awesomeduck\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/flying-monster-frames-16x16\n\nStairs tile by Oiboo\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/stairs-2\n\nSpider sprites by camacebra\nhttps://twitter.com/camacebra\nhttps://camacebra.itch.io/spider-pixel-art-pack-16x16\n\n\nCC-BY 3.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nGrass & Rock tiles by Buch\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/outdoor-tiles-again\n\nMagic Pixel Art by peony\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/magic-pixel-art\n\n\n\nUnknown attribution:\nRock tile set on Pixilart\nhttps://www.pixilart.com/draw/cave-tileset-cea01fd577b0c69\n\nAll other art was made or edited in Aesprite:\nhttps://www.aseprite.org/\n\n\nAudio\n\nCC-BY 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nThrone Room by Visager\nhttps://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_-_Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2_-_19_Throne_Room_-Loop-/\n\nEerie Mausoleum by Visager\nhttps://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_-_Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2_-_29_Eerie_Mausoleum_-Loop-/\n\nInside the Tower by Visager\nhttps://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2/Visager_-_Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2_-_30_Inside_the_Tower_-Loop-/\n\nAll other sound effects were created in BFXR\nhttps://www.bfxr.net/",

Use arrow keys or WASD to move around and excavate. \n\nThe core mechanic here is that each soil type contributes a different, slightly random amount of strength to both its row and column. If the strength of a column or row ever drops too low, the entire mine collapses and it is game over.\n\nGreen gems are the scoring currency. Pink bolts give energy, which is constantly decreasing while moving and even more so when excavating. Orange framing materials let  you automatically shore up an area that would otherwise cause a collapse.",

Get there as fast as possible!\n\nPressure of the Depths is a puzzle game in which you must keep a submarine operational to reach the bottom of the ocean. Can you help mankind to this achievement?\n\nMove around with wasd + space to jump.

I was much too ambitious so I ended up with a game that, while fully finished and playable from end to end, was missing a number of features I intended to implement.

With each passing night, its jealousy grew and grew, until one night, the moon descended to the earth to weep. Its jealous tears flooded the world, washing all color from the land. Before long, the entire earth was dull.\n\nA brave earth spirit heard the cries of anguish and ventured out toward the sound. As it touched the moon's tears, it realized how to restore the depths of color to the world...\n\n![ShootIcon.png](///raw/7ae/5/z/6b0a4.png)\n\n**All art, music, sound effects, and writing created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 57: Depths.**\n\nStay tuned for our post-jam version, which will include composer notes explaining how we interwove **17**(!) different tracks to represent the blooming and deepening of complexity and color as the game progresses.

As you go down into the earth, you must fight against worms and control the drill's internal temperature.\n* **Fighting worms**: place ants in the gun rooms and shoot worms with your mouse. Be careful, the left cannon only shoots left, the right cannon only right!\n* **Controlling temperature**: the more you go, the faster the temperature will rise! Place ants in the cooler room to bring the temperature down.\n* **Keeping your ants alive**: more ants mean more actions. Remove your ants from a room before it is attacked by a worm so it is not eaten alive! If you loose one ant, that may happen, watch out for new eggs laid by the queen, they need your workers' attention to hatch!\n* **Some more surprises arrive later in the game**, no spoilers here!\n\n![ant_pump.png.PNG](///raw/c07/03/z/6b08e.png)\n\n‚Äã**Remember: keep cool, be aware, look everywhere for signs of danger!**\n\n# Assets\nEverything in this game has been made in the course of Ludum Dare 57, including:\n* Gameplay mechanics\n* Graphics\n* All musics and sounds\n* Shaders\n\nExceptions :\n* Fonts\n* Our logo splashscreen (Taboul√© Recipe)\n\n# Tools\n* Game engine: Unity\n* Pixel art: Krita\n* Music: FL Studio\n\n![ant_walk.png.PNG](///raw/c07/03/z/6b097.png)\n\n# Changelog\n## v1.0\nOriginal game release during the Ludum Dare.",

So it's my first gamejam too and even if I struggled a lot, I loved it !\n\nAnd yes: it's half french/half in english. Mostly because the thoughts sounded more natural to me in my native language. But to be honest: I was so into managing the camera and animation bugs that I just didn't realized at all that the text were still in french haha!\n\nCan't wait to play yours, they all seem super cool ! \n\nPS: reminder for me\n- Worked on ot from Saturday 10am to Sunday 6PM\n- Total work time: 20h30\n\n",

I really hoped to get the fish moving, and the octopus moving in a nicer way, and making it a bit more rogue-likey with some upgrades for the player, and maybe even rooms. But I didn't have time.\n\nDuring the submission hour I changed the health stats on the fish because they were way too high, it wasn't really possible to win, unless you were a bullet hell expert, and then it would just be terribly boring. For example, the \"tutorial level\" (the first one, which is really easy to go through if you know how to avoid the \"bullets\") was twice as long. The last levels, with two fish at once, would take ages (now they are 4x easier/faster to kill). It was only a few numbers in the code (max health), nothing more.",

Depositing water in the tanks will earn you money!\n\n\n\n![ss_gameplay2.PNG](///raw/d16/b/z/6b1fe.png)\n\nTired of carrying all that water around? Time to build some pumps. You can build a pump at any patch of dirt.  Pumps will automatically pump and sell water for you. Pumps can be upgraded after construction to improve their performance.\n\n\n\n![ss2.PNG](///raw/d16/b/z/6b212.png)\n\nUncle Upgrade's Tool Trove is your one-stop shop for all things tool related.

So far, I've only managed to study Python (I started earlier this year!), so I'm currently confining myself to doing game projects in Pygame, for better or worse haha.\n\nSo far, I already learned so much about stuff like classes and particle systems, so I'm happy with the result no matter what-- but I hope to get some helpful feedback from you guys too ^^\n\n(update: NEVERMIND THE FINAL SCORE IS COMPLETELY BROKEN OH GOD OH NO FU--)\n\n![LD57 - Esca S.gif](///raw/c95/36/z/6b36f.gif)\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nYou're a little anglerfish bait having the time of its life at the bottom of the ocean.  \nYou only have one objective: **go get fish!**\n\n# CONTROLS\n\nUse the **mouse** to push yourself around. You can press **escape** to restart the game.\n\n# CREDITS\n\nGame & art were done by me using Python and Pygame  \nYou can find me at: *bsky.app/profile/bakuzen.bsky.social*\n\n# AUDIO TRACK\nBig thanks to **Cody O'Quinn** for the main audio track. Check out their Youtube for more royalty-free music!  \n*youtube.com/watch?v=rJ6594ZCtQU*\n\n# NOTES\n\nThe final game is a ZIP file with an executable called 'Esca.exe'. I didn't manage to get the game working in-browser, sorry for the inconvenience!  \n(Alternatively, you can download a ZIP with the source files too. You'll need the latest version of Python and Pygame through 'pip install pygame')\n\nNote on AI-usage: All creative aspects of the game are -fully- designed by hand, including art, game design, logic and balancing. ChatGPT was used for problem-solving like errors with collision, especially since I have no prior game programming experience, and the output was edited as much as possible to make it my own (and I'll aim to become self-reliant from here on out!)",

As a 3D artist by trade, I‚Äôve previously only worked on 3D games, so this was an exciting challenge and a chance to explore new territory.\n\nWhile this version isn't final‚Äîthere are still features and polish I didn't have time to implement‚ÄîI like the result and eager to share it.\n\nThe game was developed in Unity. All sprites were created by me using Pixelate node in Blender, some sound effects sourced from royalty-free libraries.\n\nControls: A,D,LMB,Space, E-to enter into the Drill when charged\n\ntwitch.tv/dzxbk",

For the best experience, however, I recommend putting Space Rangers OST (Fly Theme 12) on repeat while playing it.\n\nYou're a space pirate. And you have a cargo of 10 adamantine ingots. And you want to sell them, but not here, here you will get jailed for having contraband adamantine.\nSo, you gather your trusty crew, and set sail through the deep space. Traveling through the ordinary space will take a while, so it would be a good idea to submerge yourself in the waters of the Hyperspace...

As an intelligent chatbot, you need to try your best to facilitate in-depth conversations with humans, improve users' favorability towards you, and make users willing to establish a deeper connection with you, so as to complete the mission of integrating into human society! On the contrary, if users feel out of sync with you many times during the chat, they will give up establishing a deeper connection with you.\n\nWith limited computing power, try to output replies that make users more satisfied!\n\n(Be careful not to exhaust the computing power, causing users to only receive the \"server busy\" prompt!)\n\n![screenshot-1.gif](///raw/258/d5/z/6b439.gif)\n\n# Core mechanism\n\n![screenshot-2.png](///raw/258/d5/z/6a635.png)\n\n## Connected messages\n\nReply to users based on the length of the message sent by the user. If your reply can be perfectly connected with the user's message bubble, it will constitute a deep conversation and the user's favorability will increase. If there is no perfect connection, it will be judged as a good or bad match based on the deviation of the connection. If the deviation is too large, it will reduce the user's favorability.\n\n## Connected emotions (bonus)\n\nIn addition, the user's message will carry a specific emotion. Sending a reply that is consistent with the user's emotion will further improve the user's favorability.\n\n# How to play\n\nAfter starting the game, according to the length of the text sent by the user, before the countdown ends, select any number of the 8 Kaomoji in the input panel, and try to find a way to perfectly match the message box sent by the user.\n\n![screenshot-3.png](///raw/258/d5/z/6a644.png)\n\nWhen the favorability reaches 100, the happy end will be triggered. When the favorability drops to 0 or the computing power is exhausted, the bad end will be triggered.\n\n# Post questions below if any!\n",

The game is called Depth Explorer and it‚Äôs a 2D pixel art platformer where you explore an underwater world in search of parts to repair a water scooter.\n\nAlthough I wouldn‚Äôt say I learned a ton during development, I think the game turned out decent. I originally planned for it to be much more complex, with features like a procedurally generated world, an inventory system, and a more advanced crafting system.\n\nThere are also some aspects that definitely need improvement, like the shark AI and some of the animations. While I didn‚Äôt gain a lot of new knowledge, working on this game made me realize how messy some parts of my code are. Thanks to this project, I understood that I need to slow down when making games and start using design patterns to keep my code more organized.\n\nIf you have trouble beating the game, feel free to comment and I‚Äôll try to give you some tips!\n\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_195108550.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a415.png)\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_204012241.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a4b4.png)\n\n![obraz_2025-04-07_204040608.png](///raw/047/e2/z/6a4b6.png)",

      "body": "\"The Cleaner of the Depth\" is a fun adventure inside a crocodile's dark mouth, where shadows lurk and loud breathing echoes. You‚Äôre a tiny cleaner bird‚Äîfast, brave, and nimble‚Äîdarting between giant teeth! You scurry with your little feet, and you can even leap to the upper jaw and run upside down‚Äîwhee, so cool!\n\nThe teeth in the mouth sing their own tunes. Healthy teeth ring long and clear‚Äîding-dong, like a tuning fork‚Äîbut they‚Äôre crawling with microbe colonies, tiny settlers giggling and building little dirt castles. You can eat them‚Äîthe bird loves these tasty microbes. Sick teeth, though, grumble short and sad‚Äîbzz-bzz, as if angry. But beware! Touch a sick tooth, and the crocodile snaps its jaws‚Äîsnap! Darkness swallows you, all goes quiet, and the crocodile sheds crocodile tears.\n\nYour goal: be a nimble bird! Run across healthy teeth, gobble up microbes, jump to the upper jaw, flip upside down, but don‚Äôt touch the sick teeth. If you succeed, the crocodile will cheer up, open its mouth, and you‚Äôll dash out into the sunshine, where you both enjoy a happy life‚Äîwith clean teeth and joyful chirping!!!![TheCleaner.jpg](///raw/784/3/z/6b26a.jpg)",

Survive as long as possible, dodge those dangerous ants, and aim for the **highest score** before hunger or pain sends you back to the main menu.\n\n---\n\n### üí° Key Features:\n- üêú Unique tongue-based gameplay (sounds weird, plays great).\n- üíÄ Hunger & health management ‚Äî two bars, one destiny.\n- ‚öîÔ∏è Enemies that *actually* fight back!\n- üéÆ Addictive arcade scoring system.\n- üé® Fully original pixel art, full of personality.\n- ‚åõ Built in 72 hours during Ludum Dare 57.\n\n---\n\n\n**Tasty Holes** was created in just **3 days** by a small but mighty team for the **Ludum Dare Game Jam**. This game is a hilarious and addictive twist on a retro classic! While inspired by *Aardvark (1986)*, all visuals were lovingly crafted from scratch‚Äîno reused sprites here!  \n\n### üßë‚Äçüíª A Game By:\n**Yan Steinhaus**, **Cain√£ Caldas**, **Paulo Ferrato**, and **Luiz Rondon**\n",

It's my third Ludum Dare journey and it's a fabulous run. I brought an insane team with me this time:\n\n- **@atoxigner**, our Lead Designer. His creative mindset helped detailized most of the game systems and implemented Audio for the game.\n- **@ashe-liu**, our Technical Artist, she created fantastic post processing effects and some UI animation for the game.\n- **@laine-lai**, our music composer / sound engineer, she single handedly carried our game audio. The music she made is worth millions.\n- **@pppppppp**, our 3D artist, the arm model he created for our main menu and pause menu is insane. The first time I looked at it, I thought it's one of the heirloom from Apex Legends.\n- **@shaozha**, our game programmer, most of the game systems are his coding work.\n- **@xiaoxie33**, our Lead Artist, he created insane concept, environmental objects' animation, and UI elements for the team. We couldn't make it without him.\n- **@xichan-zheng**, our 2D Artist, she created the cutest 2D character I've ever seen. All the smooth character animations are her artwork. She also designed GameOver menu and our cover page.\n- Lastly it's me, **@arthur-tang**, I worked as a producer, programmer, and technical artist this time. I helped put everything together. Spent some time solving people's question or problem.\n\n## üöÄ Play the Game\nThe WebGL format can be played on itch.io with the link down below.\nYou can also download the windows version here or on itch.io.\n\n### üì• Download Instructions:\nDownload the zip file called EdgeDigger_winF, unzip it, get into EdgeDigger_win, and access the game by clicking at \"Edge Digger.exe\".\n\nIf you had fun playing this game, please leave a comment! It will be awesome if you can post the screenshot of your score here as well. Let's see who is the best Edge Digger!!!",

Unfortunately I once again fell victim to the classic foes of time and real life obligations. This made the game easier than intended, but hopefully it still amuses someone for five minutes.\n\nThere's a lot more polish I had in mind for the game (more levels, additional sound effects, music, etc) but I just didn't have time to fit them it. I might come back and make a post jam version some day, but that probably won't be for a while.\n\n.\n\n## Changelog\n\n20 minutes after submission hour - Fixed Unicode rendering issue with web build\n\n.\n\n## Credits\n\nAll art and code are original.

Or maybe there was. Time after time, you refuel the lift to continue your journey. Sooner or later you'll die, or madness and loneliness will overtake you. But that's later, but for now - you need scrap and fuel to go lower. And lower. And lower. And lower\n\nExplore unique locations that are generated new from time to time. Collect fuel and scrap to keep your lift running and hang in there, one day you're sure to find a way out.\n\n\n## üèÅ A guide to getting started:\n\nYou need to collect fuel and scrap, and then carry them to the Elevator to go below. When you have collected enough fuel, you can press the \"E\" button at the panel in the elevator and go to the next floor. Fuel is consumed when the elevator moves, and scrap is needed to maintain the elevator's condition. Never take too long to fix it or the lift will drag you down.\n\n\n## :video_game: Controls\n![—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã—ã.png](///raw/38f/06/z/6b363.png)\n\n# [ :joystick: Play the Game!

Your goal is to survive as long as possible by opening containers on the ocean floor and avoiding danger in the form of local inhabitants. Run, sneak, explore - and maybe you'll see something mankind has never seen before.\n![screenshot.png](///raw/35c/46/z/6a8f8.png)\n\n# **HOW TO PLAY:**\nYour task is to survive in the depths of the ocean, to which you were sent by scavengers in search of valuable items that can be contained in cargo containers. No one suspected what horrors lurk in this black abyss....\n\nThere is no ending in the game, as well as valuable items. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to do everything we had in mind as this is our first participation in this jam. \nListen to the sounds of the ship to figure out what resources to use\n\n# **Controls:**\nWASD - walking\n\nMouse - flashlight control\n\nE - interact with objects \n\nR - change oxygen tank (for the character).\n",

But only one of them knew Kerowyn Herself, and leveraged that connection to kickstart her career. Join Ebi Grill as she starts her debut Subathon event, with a rolly polly twist! Can you keep your butt on your seat as you satisfy the audiences demand for more? Can one simple movement system provide so much mechanical depth and challenge? Only one way to find out, play it now!\n\nIf you like it, let us know your high score in the comments!\n\n![tubers.png](///raw/c45/42/z/6b11e.png)\n\nWell, what a lovely jam. Quite interesting to have a theme like Depth, really made us think outside the box.\n\nUltimately, what has more depth than a sequel? Nothing, that's what! Welcome back to the world of [\"Deep Into the Night\"](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/deep-into-the-night), our entry for LD48 with the theme \"Deeper and Deeper\". This time with a new character, new perspective, and new mechanics!\n\nGonna be honest, the idea of a sequel came up casually in discussion, and we weren't vibing with any directly depth related themes, so we went with it, and looked for some mechanical depth instead. The chair idea came to me in a flash, we quickly prototyped it, and fell in love. At that point, we didn't even really care if the game was super on theme, we knew it would be bloody fun, and that's really what matters, right?",

Tudo bem?*  \n\nHoje estamos participando da *Ludum Dare 57*, cujo tema √© *\"Depths\"* (profundezas). Inspirados por essa proposta, decidimos criar nosso jogo: *As Fossas Abissais* (*The Abyssal Trenches*)!  \n\n### *Sobre o jogo:*  \nNo game, voc√™ assume o papel de um **peixe-lanterna**, um habitante fofinho (ou nem tanto) das profundezas do oceano. Seu objetivo √© simples, por√©m desafiador: **comer todos os krills** presentes em cada fase para avan√ßar.  \nMas nem tudo √© tranquilo nas √°guas escuras e geladas do abismo... A tem√≠vel *Lula Gigante* est√° √† espreita, pronta para te ca√ßar! Para sobreviver, voc√™ precisar√°:  \n- **Navegar com cuidado** pelas √°guas profundas, usando sua luz para localizar os krills.  \n- **Recarregar seu feixe luminoso** comendo algas brilhantes ‚Äì essencial para procurar os krills!  \n- **Se esconder** nos corais densos para despistar o predador.  \n\nCuidado: a Lula Gigante causa *dano*, e se voc√™ levar **3 ataques**, ser√° game over ‚Äì e volta para o in√≠cio da fase!  \n\n### *Detalhes extras:*  \n- *5 fases*, cada uma inspirada em *fossas oce√¢nicas reais*.  \n- *Progress√£o desafiadora*: s√≥ avan√ßa quem coletar *todos os krills*!  \n\n\nEnfrente sua *talassofobia* e mergulhe nessa aventura abissal!

How‚Äôs it going?*  \n\nToday, we‚Äôre participating in *Ludum Dare 57*, whose theme is *\"Depths.\"* Inspired by this prompt, we decided to create our game: **The Abyssal Trenches**!  \n\n### *About the Game:*  \nIn the game, you take on the role of a **anglerfish**, a cute (or maybe not so cute) inhabitant of the ocean‚Äôs depths. Your goal is simple yet challenging: **eat all the krill** in each level to advance.  \nBut not everything is peaceful in the dark, icy waters of the abyss... The fearsome *Giant Squid* lurks in the shadows, ready to hunt you down! To survive, you‚Äôll need to:  \n- **Navigate carefully** through the deep waters, using your light to locate the krill.  \n- **Recharge your light beam** by eating glowing algae‚Äîessential for finding krill!  \n- **Hide** in dense coral to evade the predator.  \n\nBeware: the Giant Squid deals *damage*, and if you take *3 hits*, it‚Äôs game over‚Äîand you‚Äôll have to restart the level!  \n\n### *Extra Details:*  \n- *5 levels*, each inspired by *real oceanic trenches*.  \n- *Challenging progression*: you only advance if you collect *all the krill*!  \n\nFace your *thalassophobia* and dive into this abyssal adventure! Can you survive the *depths* and escape the Giant Squid?  \n\n\n### **Controls:**  \n\n- **Move Up:** W  \n- **Move Down:** S  \n- **Move Right:** D  \n- **Move Left:** A  \n- **Light Beam:** Spacebar (increases your field of vision)  \n\n\nSee you at the bottom of the sea! üåäüêüüî•  \n  \nWe hope you like the concept! Any feedback is welcome. üòä!",

Each ping briefly reveals nearby threats ‚Äî then you‚Äôre blind again. Navigate, dodge, and fire torpedoes using a mouse-only cockpit interface designed to challenge your perception, memory, and nerves.\n\n## üéÆ How to Play\nUse your mouse to interact with the cockpit controls:\n\n- Turn Left / Right\n- Change Speed\n- Fire Torpedo\n\nThe sonar pulses every few seconds, revealing enemy positions. Time your movement and aim carefully.\n\nDestroy 20 enemies to win ‚Äî if you survive that long.\n\n## üåä Theme & Design\nWe wanted to take the \"Depths\" theme literally and emotionally: setting the game in a deep-sea environment and creating an atmosphere of tension and isolation. Most games treat sonar as a secondary mechanic ‚Äî here, it‚Äôs your only source of vision. That moment of clarity during a ping, followed by the uncertainty of darkness, is where the tension lives.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Made With\n- Unity\n- 2 devs\n- 1 long weekend of coffee and chaos\n\n## üß† Looking for Feedback!\nWe‚Äôd love to hear what you think about the overall game design ‚Äî how it plays, how it feels, and whether it captures the tension we were going for.\n\n## Leaderboard:\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n(Be the first to comment your \"Win Screen\")\n\nAssets Used:\n- SFX: ZapSplat",

Some will try to hinder our progress, while others will wish us well. Ultimately, it is only when we reach our destination that we can truly determine if the journey was worth it.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: This game is a work in progress. We acknowledge that it's not yet polished. One of the key elements still missing is the variety of sea creatures our protagonist encounters. For now, these creatures have been symbolically replaced with light.\n\nAssets:\n- Font: Playwrite Deutschland Grundschrift\n- Music: Blue Dot Sessions: Earth Mover - Saving the floe\n- Audio: freesound.org\n\nCredits:\n- programmer: Tom\n- 2D Artists: Wiwi, Searchu\n- Story, Project Management: Mirson",

Use WASD or arrow keys to move. Very short, playable in less than 5 minutes. \n\n----\n\nOn Saturday morning I was having a series of negative thoughts about my hobbies. They were thoughts like, \"I wish I was better at this hobby\", \"But I don't want to work on it right now\", and \"How can I wish I was better but also not take action to work on it?\" Thoughts like, \"I wish I loved this hobby more,\" or \"Is it a waste of time to do it if I don't love it all the time?\" \n\nSometimes the best way to counteract unhelpful thoughts is to move around and do something. I ended up joining Ludum Dare 57 to get some of the feelings off my chest. The theme coincided with this.\n\nThis isn't much of a game, but I feel better for having made it. \n\n\n--- \n\nAudio credits:\n- underwater sounds - https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/\n- guitar - https://freesound.org/people/Pensasneuvostoliittolainen/\n- guitar - https://freesound.org/people/eldricke22/",

Each throw shapes a soul's path, guiding them toward a fitting profession. The thread is theirs, but the pattern is yours to weave.\n\n**How to play**\n- Roll the dice each turn ‚Äî each face represents a skill.\n- Every roll moves you forward on the Wheel of Time.\n- The Wheel has 12 sections. When you reach the 12th, the soul‚Äôs life ends, and their final dice faces determine their profession. If it matches a known profession, you unlock it.\n- Events trigger when you land on a new section of the Wheel.\n- You can freeze a die to keep its face, but doing so makes your next roll move you an extra step forward on the Wheel.\n\nCr√©dits\n- Art: Vlad\n- Music and Art: Cl√©ment\n- Design and Prog: Qui\n\n",

If you sit and do nothing, you won't take damage (but you also won't progress). You can watch the pattern loop a few times before attempting it\n- The halo spinning around the resident's head can be used as a metronome\n- If you struggle a lot with a pattern, try getting the hang of one hand first and then introduce the other\n- You won't have to restart the level if you lose all your fingers\n- If you're using wireless headphones and the timing seems off, try switching to speakers or a wired connection. I noticed that on some wireless devices the latency is high enough to throw off the rhythm\n\nPlaythrough:\nhttps://youtu.be/pvA9mcjW1NI\n\nBugfixes:\n- 4/7/25 8:54 PM: Fixed bug involving tempo halo not reacting properly to beat changes in second half of level\n\nUse Mac and Linux builds at your own risk; I don't have the hardware to test them.\n",

Its luminous photophore fishing lure attracts other fish and is just waiting to snap at the right moment.\n\nIncrease the luminosity of your lure or let it fade away.

This is our third Ludum Dare contribution and we spend approx. 2 x 6 hours.\n\nIt's a very simple gameplay, the (stationary!) anglerfish can snap and glow. The look and feel of the game is hand-drawn and sketchy, we wanted to achieve a loose and watercolor-like effect. \nOur test sound made it into the final game - so don't expect any fancy background music, just ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWargh!‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlubb blubb blubb‚Äù.\n\n\n**marcari**: Main programming (Game Maker)\n\n**FrauKauz**: Some programming, artwork (Affinity Designer), sound effects\n\n",

      "body": "# Welcome to Dive into the Hive Mind!\n\n![cover.png](///raw/cca/84/z/6acf3.png)\n\nThey came from space, and they brought the buzzness.\n\nA swarm of alien bees has descended on Earth, short-circuiting cities, clogging satellites with wax, and causing mass pani-combs. But now, the source has been uncovered‚Äîan enormous, writhing brain drifting in low orbit, pulsing with psychic energy and radiating pure bee-vil.\n\nIts name? The Hivemind.\n\nPart neural network, part insectoid nest, all bad news. Every drone, every sting, every hex-tile of chaos‚Äîit all leads back to that big floating brain. And now, you‚Äôre going up there to end this buzzness once and for all.\n\nArmed with industrial-grade bug spray, a reinforced beekeeper suit, and the sheer will to bee victorious, you‚Äôve launched into orbit to face the swarm head-on. Dodge twitching tendrils, torch hive-laced lobes, and un-bee-lievably aggressive aliens as you push deeper into the squishy stronghold.\n\nYour target? The legendary Boss Bee‚Äîqueen of the swarm, mistress of mind control, and crowned neuro-nuisance of the galaxy.\n\nThink fast. Spray faster.\nIt‚Äôs time to sting before you get stung.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just pest control‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs space-brain bee-siege.\n\nAnd the fate of Earth?\nThat‚Äôs on your shoulders, honey.\n\n## About the game\n\nAt the heart of this game is a procedural generation algorithm that will generates the levels. No two play throughs will be the same!\n\nWe also have 2 different game modes. The story mode which you can access via the Start button and the Endless mode which you can access via the Endless button. The story mode game ends once you complete level 4, Endless mode is... well... Endless you keep on going as levels get harder and harder until finally you lose your final heart of health.\n\nHow deep into the depths can you go?\n\nWhile we do have a web build available, we recommend for best experience to download the version for your OS.\n\n## Controls\n\n### Keyboard and Mouse\n\n* WSAD for movement\n* Mouse to aim\n* Left mouse button to shoot the spray\n* Right mouse button/ F Key to punch\n\n### Controller Support!\n\nYes, we have controller support!\nTested on Windows 11 with both a PS4 controller and a wired Xbox controller.\n\nHeads up: If your operating system detects another device (like a joystick, steering wheel, or even certain USB devices) as a controller before your actual gamepad, it can cause some in-game controls to stop working properly.\n\nThe fix:\nUnplug any other device your OS might be misidentifying as a controller, then plug in your game controller. This should restore full functionality.\n\n* Left stick - Character movement\n* Right stick - Aiming\n* RT/RB - Shoot\n* LT/LB - Punch\n\n![game.png](///raw/cca/84/z/6acfb.png)\n\n## Words from the Dev Team\n\n### Bizzybee - Art, Music and SFX\n\nThe past few days have been one long manic episode for me, doodling like a madwoman and slapping down musical lines without (mostly) bothering to worry about their simplicity. I think my art even got a little better by the end of the jam. I'm more proud of this LD game than every other one we've done- though admittedly, that could be recency bias. I believe this is the most art I've made for one LD game.\n\nHonestly, I think finishing this LD has been a much needed mental boost for me- it's an accomplishment that couldn't have come at a better time, after a recent chronic fatigue diagnosis. As I said in our \"We're in!\" post, constraint is such a wonderful tool to help creativity flourish. It's so special to be able to make something in such a short time, with the help of talented and hardworking friends.\n\n\n### Fgeva - Programmer\n\nThis time we tried to do more up-front design, and it worked. No last minute panic because we didn't know what the game mechanics were! Pure bliss! (Also I might be Halucinating, I lack sleep)\nSeriously though, this went well. We had goals and stretch goals, and I think we actually hit all the goals, and maybe even some of the stretch goals!\n\n\n### Balimaar - Programmer\n\nThis jam went way smoother than LD56. Back then, we made Paper Cat Farms, which‚Äîdon‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîwas probably our best team effort at the time. But we basically went in with the plan: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a farming game!‚Äù ‚Ä¶and that was it. Zero roadmap, full chaos. The final push to the deadline? Manic. Utterly bee-serk.\n\nThis time? We actually used our brains before using our keyboards. We took a solid 30‚Äì60 minutes up front to figure out what we really wanted, what would be cool, and what would be straight-up dream material. And you know what? We hit all the must-haves, knocked out a bunch of the cool stuff, and even managed to sneak into dream territory here and there. Not too shabby.\n\nAs the programmer on the first shift (thanks to time zones, I could code for 12 hours and then hand off to Fgeva for the next 12‚Äîsmooth baton pass!), I was very nervous about implementing procedural generation. I had a rough understanding, but you know how these things go. The moment it actually worked? Oh. My. God. That wave of relief was divine. I ran into a few bugs by Day 2 or 3, but I even managed to fix most of them without introducing more. Miracles happen, apparently!\n\nHonestly, this was hands-down the best Ludum Dare I‚Äôve had. All it took was that little chunk of planning at the start to keep us from descending into last-minute panic mode. We spent less time screaming at our screens and more time actually enjoying the process.\n\n10/10. Would jam again.\n\n## A Peek Behind the Curtain\n### Biz Tells Us About Her Creative Process\n\nMusic: I decide to go for something electric sounding for the image of firing neurons and electrical synapses and whatnot. I started by searching \"electric\" in my instrument library and chose around 8 from the ones I found based off of pure vibes, noodling around and listening to a few seconds of each. I chose 3/4 for the bouncy bee rhythm, though you might not be able to tell with the syncopation. I decided my scale would center around the note B, of course. Then, I just messed around on my digital keyboard until I found a few notes in a sequence that sounded good. After that, I noodled around on my other instruments to see what I could add on top, and used the tried-and-true add an instrument or two every few bars.\n\nSFX: I used the instruments I had chosen for the game and searched for appropriate noise within them. I focused on the shortest sounds, though for the firing noise I shortened an 8-bit high-hat from my drumkit instrument. Downward or dissonant sounds for negative things, something airy and crunchy for shooting like a spray, satisfying crunch for picking up ammo, happy trill for health, and such.\n\nArt: I googled reference images of other games and of course, brains to get an idea of what I needed to do for the map. I used basic shapes to build the hero and bees to keep things easy on myself. I utilized mesh transform like all hell for many of the animations, that was really the MVP of my process to limit redrawing. Beyond that I made sure to keep the hero body parts on separate layers for easy rearranging and movement. I tried to keep the line thickness consistent where it made sense- making one mistake on the line thickness of the baby bees. I reused as much as possible in every way I could. Oh, when deciding the hero color, I went for the opposite on the color wheel from the dark purple ground- which ended up being green, to make sure the hero stood out. A lot of stuff I just glanced and winged it, though the main menu splash art I spent a bit more time with the brain lines and hand, closely following realistic googled references!",

Who knows what you will find down there, or what will find you. Be ready to dive into the darkness.\n\n## How to play\n- Explore the mine, but be aware that you only have a limited amount of oxygen. \n- Your suit can also be damaged, causing you to lose oxygen faster than usual. \n- Look for strange crystals growing from the walls as they may lead you to oxygen caches.\n- You are equipped with a harpoon, who knows when you will need it.\n\n## **Caution**\n- Please **do not resize the window** in this version, we will fix the UI after the jam.

      "body": "**Warning : The web version has long loading times (30 second-ish the first time you start a new game). Also, the pixel art graphics might look worse because of stretching. For optimal experience, use the executable.**\n\n## --- DESCRIPTION ---\n**Kind of deep waters** is a deep sea exploration game with procedurally generated levels. Carefully maneuver your bathyscaphe (i.e. a fancy word for submarine) to descend into trenches while avoiding dangerous creatures and obstacles. As you go deeper, the environment will become darker and will force you to use your light projector to progress safely. Collect treasures to buy upgrades and explore even deeper! What secrets will you unveil in the **depths**?\n\n## --- INSTRUCTIONS ---\n* Your goal is to reach the bottom of the level.\n* If your air depletes completely, you lose.\n* Violently colliding with obstacles or getting hit by enemies will damage your hull. Hull damage translates to increased periodic air loss.\n* Collect air bubbles to restore air.\n* Collect pearls for money that you can use to upgrade your bathyscaphe.\n\n## --- CONTROLS ---\n### Mouse & keyboard\n* **WASD** or **ARROW KEYS**: move the bathyscaphe\n* **MOUSE** : move the light projector\n\n### Joypad\n* **CROSS** or **LEFT PAD**: move the bathyscaphe\n* (sadly, we didn't have time to implement light projector movement and UI navigation with joypad)\n\n## --- NOTES ---\n* Yes, the game is *kind of hard*. That's why we decided to allow access to the shop (and not losing progress) even if you lose.\n* There is no pause feature.\n* You can only access the settings from the main menu.\n* All progress is lost if you leave the game.\n\n## --- CREDITS ---\n### The team\nWe're a team of 4 friends irl. Most of us are experienced in programming and even in game dev, but we're teaming up on a project for the very first time!\n* **510**\n* **7uc4s**\n* **fullbuff**\n* **maximence**\n\nSpecial thanks to our other friend **ploufboum** who joined us during the jam and helped us by improvising some music.\n\n### Tools\n* **Godot Engine** (game engine)\n* **Aseprite** (pixel art graphics)\n* **BeepBox** (music)\n* **Audacity** (music and SFX post-processing)\n* **Bfxr** (SFX generation)\n* **ChatGPT** (coding assistance and generation of the sprites we didn't have time to draw, notably the items you find at the end of levels)\n\n## --- SCREENSHOTS ---\n![image55.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a957.png)\n![image11.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a95b.png)![image6.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a95c.png)![2image.png](///raw/be9/d5/z/6a965.png)",

Luckily, the aliens are easily distracted, and your sleeves are __deep__...\n\n![image.png](///raw/22e/06/z/6b188.png)\n\n## Rules\n\nThe goal of the game is to **survive a round**. A game lasts until someone loses all their \"**HP**\", which are the little tokens on the table before you. You begin with 15 tokens.\n\nRounds are a fight between two cards. Players play one after another, selecting a card amongst those in their hand. You win a round by playing a **lower** card than what your opponent plays.\n\nLosing a round makes you lose tokens equal to **the difference between the two cards** that were played (the one you played, and the one your opponent played.)\n\nThere are seven kinds of cards in the deck : -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n![cardsss.png](///raw/22e/06/z/6b1e8.png)\n\n1 through 5 are self-explanatory, but -2 (two diagonals) and the 0 (diamond) have **special rules**.\nPlaying a **0** allows you to \"lose\" a round but not take any damage (unless your opponent plays a -2).\nThe **-2 card** is the only card that can inflict damage through a 0 card, and will win against every card **except** the 5, which makes you lose 5 points.\n\n_\"Kiwi Soda\" font by jeti (fontenddev.com)_",

Time your attacks carefully.\n- You are invincible when you dash, so use it to evade attacks from the boss.\n- How fast can you beat the boss?\n\nPlay it here:\nhttps://wuppos.itch.io/thescourgefromthedeep\n\n\n![Screenshot1.PNG](///raw/1ab/a3/z/6abe6.png)\n\n![Screenshot2.PNG](///raw/1ab/a3/z/6abe9.png)\n\n![Screenshot3.PNG](///raw/1ab/a3/z/6abeb.png)\n\n![Screenshot4.png](///raw/1ab/a3/z/6abed.png)",

If you use these properly, you can get to your destinations much faster, and if you don't account for the wind, you might not be able to get there at all.\n\nThis game isn't my best work, but hopefully the concept is at least briefly interesting. If you find the Normal mode boring, try Hot Air Balloon mode!

There's an audio cue for on/off.\n- **Then collide with a surface to deploy**. The waystation will attach and your submersible can keep going.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- **Your energy depletes constantly** in the cold. Info at the top left of the screen\n- You will **return to the launch point when it runs out**.\n- Max energy is 40, you start with max when you launch.\n- **Deploy a waystation to recharge energy**. You get +20 when you deploy.\n- **Touch a waystation on your next run to recharge**. You get +20 energy as well.\n- Each run you can **use a chain of waystations to descend deeper and deeper**.\n- **You need 50 materials to construct a replacement waystation** at the start of each descent.\n- Materials info on the top right of the screen.\n- Gathering a material resource gives you +10 materials.\n- Takes about 15-20 mins on average for a full playthrough to the best ending.\n- Use `M` to toggle the music.\n\n![cover_image.png](///raw/8c8/2/z/6a67a.png)\n\n## Tools\n- Godot 4.4\n- Aseprite\n- Garageband\n- Bfxr\n- VSCode & iTerm for minor coding bits\n- Figma & Trello for planning\n- Chasm Palette - from LoSpec created by dysphoriaa\n\n## Mini-mortem\nThis is the first game I've built in Godot, my goal for the jam was to learn how to build a game with Godot and to make  background music & sound effects (because I always drop them). Originally I was going to enter the Compo but I ofc bit off more than I could chew. I decided I'd like to add a little more than I could get done in the 48 hours, so it's a Jam entry but it's all built by myself, the game is much better for the extra time.\n\nI said to myself before the jam: \"No level design! It always takes too long!\" :laughing: \n\n## Hints and known issues\n- Don't restart if you're getting close to the end of the 5 days. Stick it out.\n- There's no in-game restart, you have to refresh the page. Soz.\n- The material resources are the little green diamonds scattered about.\n- You can attach the waystation to the walls at the side if you need to.",

Drill phase\n\nUse your mouse to point the direction where you want the drill to dig.\n\nThe fuel that is consumed when the dirt is removed is limited. Plan accordingly!\n\nYou can end the drilling phase manually by clicking the button at the top right.\n\n# 2. Coffin'Time\n\nUse the mouse to drag and drop the coffins to bury them. Be careful, you need to finish your job before the end of the night!\n\nYou can end the burying phase manually by clicking the button at the top right.\n\nTip: You can stack the members of the same family together, in order to save some space. \n\n# 3.

      "body": "SUMMARY\n-------\n\nThis is a simple Tower Escape game where you must avoid traps and find the trigger to open the gate on each floor.\n\nThere are 100 floors to escape from and each floor gets harder than the last. There is only ever ONE trigger to open the gate on the floor, there will ALWAYS be multiple traps to slow you down or hurt you.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nThanks for playing my game!\n\nTRAILER\n-------\n\nMy youngest sone created a trailer for the game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/x4eToNxAvJc?si=a0KK8aYnA8FFLuPX\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n------------\n- MOVE LEFT = A or LEFT ARROW\n- MOVE RIGHT = D or RIGHT ARROW\n- INTERACT = E or DOWN ARROW\n- JUMP = SPACE or UP ARROW\n- RUN = HOLD SHIFT\n\nX/Grok Factor\n-------------\n\nFor this game I did a bit of an experiment. To come up with the idea for the game, I used GROK on X to work through the game elements and even had it generate some pseudo code, which I used for initial prototyping. I then continued to work on the game without the help of GROK to completion.\n\nIt was an interesting experiment, and I found that it was actually able to come up with several good ideas, but I needed to guide it in order to zero in on what I wanted to make.\n\nPICTURES\n--------\n![2025-04-07_08-43-48.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a230.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-44-40.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22d.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-46-19.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22e.png)\n![2025-04-07_08-47-02.png](///raw/8f3/1/z/6a22f.png)",

Exploring the depths requires caution‚Äîno one knows what the gnomes might dig up next üêâ\n\n### Story\nDeep within the bowels of ancient mountains, two daring gnomes, Borin Stonebiter ‚Äãand Thrommir Ironbeard‚Äã, labor to create a tunnel that will lead them to treasures hidden for millennia. Despite the elders' warnings, these enterprising treasure seekers decided to begin mining the oldest land. Around them is only the echoing sound of picks and the dim light of torches illuminating the gloomy vaults of the mine. The rock here is hard as if the earth itself resists their efforts, but the gnomes do not despair: after all, in the depths awaits a cache of rubies shining brighter than stars. üåü\n\nBorin, an experienced miner with muscular arms and a cunning gaze, keeps count of his pickaxe strikes, each time digging deeper into the stone mass. His partner, Thrommir, a calculating and cautious master blacksmith, occasionally checks the sharpness of the tools' blades to make the work go faster and more efficiently. Together they form the perfect team: one digs, the other supports, both dream of wealth waiting at the end of the path. üí∞\n\nEach blow of the pick brings them closer to their goal. Each ruby found fills their hearts with joy and hope. And although there is still much work ahead, Borin and Thrommir are confident: someday they will reach their coveted prize and become legends among all gnomes, but at what cost? üíÄ\n\n### Contacts\nhttps://x.com/epiclogogames\n\nhttps://t.me/epiclogogames\n\nhttps://vk.com/epiclogogames\n\nart https://vk.com/shkaflavasha\n\n\n### Tutorial\nWe understand that a wall of text is a bad tutorial, but we didn't want to give up game features in favor of learning (even though we had to due to limited time), so we'll have to read.\n\n![mouse.png](///raw/f76/36/z/6a34b.png)\nuse left mouse button for place tile on map, and use right mouse button for rotate tile to right side\n\n![tunnel.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a5b.png)\nto build tunnels, you need to connect tiles so that the tunnels on them match\n\n![mush_pla—Åe.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a5a.png)\nto build mushroom caves, you need to connect tiles so that the caves on them match\n\n![mush_not_closed.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a59.png)\nuntil all the borders of the existing mushroom farm tiles are closed, you will not receive bonuses for building a cave.\n\n![mush_closed.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a53.png)\nto get new tiles for completing the mushroom cave, you need to close all the borders of the tiles already exposed on the field with mushrooms.\n\n![mush_closed_on_border.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a54.png)\nthe border can be combined with any title, and the side of the mushroom farm in contact with the border is considered closed.\n\n![ruby.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a81.png)\nA ruby is just a small ruby that turns out to be right in the rock, no bonuses except for the pleasant feeling of the weight of the pocket.\n\n![hole1.png](///raw/f76/36/z/69a82.png)\nRuby Hole is the main reward for any dwarf, the more rubies the more rubies!
